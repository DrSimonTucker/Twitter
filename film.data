FB:::Phelimo:::DIRECT:::@klymlove Scorsese has production credits on most of his films, company credits too. No Bond director has ever had that, never will.
TW:::Phelimo:::@klymlove It's more to do with ownership than freedom, Cameron, Speilberg, etc make their own Bond-ish movies with True Lies, Raiders, etc
GP:::Phelimo:::random:::@klymlove All the really big directors would love to do a Bond (I'm sure) but they can't work with the business side (lack of control/money)
FB:::Phelimo:::GROUP:::@klymlove Yeah, Campbell's only really good when he's directing Bonds (and his 1st Zorro), seems nuts not to keep him on.
TW:::Phelimo:::@klymlove I agree with that sentiment. Who would you suggest for the gig?
GP:::Phelimo:::random:::@klymlove I'm no fan of Mendes, he might do ok, too many variable in this to call it this early. I like to be optimistic about Bond.
FB:::Phelimo:::WALL:::@klymlove They can leave the action stuff almost entirely to the second unit director (like in Kick-Ass), so it shouldn't matter too much.
TW:::Phelimo:::Quite excited about seeing the return of Dubstar tonight. Might have to get drunk and emotional.

FB:::Phelimo:::GROUP:::@klimny It's pretty gritty.
TW:::Phelimo:::@peacockpete @unklerupert "She has the skills and strength of 10 hookers" It's the ultimate in crack-whore horror.

FB:::dannytheleigh:::GROUP:::@WordsofColour Well, nuance is a famously tricky business in 140 characters. Or 2 minutes of live TV.
TW:::dannytheleigh:::@WordsofColour ...but if that's what you think, that's what you think. 'Locked down' all round it seems.
GP:::dannytheleigh:::random:::@WordsofColour It's a little weird being (I think) accused of being a loudmouth/chauvinist when having (I thought) a civil exchange...
FB:::dannytheleigh:::WALL:::@WordsofColour But she WAS positive about it.
TW:::dannytheleigh:::@WordsofColour Aspect of film I said was grotesque was equating problems of whites + blacks in 60s Deep South. Which it does.
GP:::dannytheleigh:::random:::@MarkECMorris OK down this way. If you're about let's try to fix up a visit (L obviously better at logistics than me).
FB:::dannytheleigh:::DIRECT:::@jj_dunning David Mellor, Dennis Waterman, Ken Bates, Kerry Dixon, Tony Banks, Damon Albarn... your boys took a hell of a beating...
TW:::dannytheleigh:::@WordsofColour ... in terms of portrait of Deep South. Do take yr point, but what Stockett/Taylor doing really OK?
GP:::dannytheleigh:::random:::@WordsofColour Think equating Skeeter & Abeleine (as both book and film do) an awful choice to make. MB is flawed, sure, but much less so...
FB:::dannytheleigh:::GROUP:::@rosstmiller Definitely - she has a TINY role in World Trade Center too, where she's pretty much much the best thing in it.
TW:::dannytheleigh:::@JaneyLambert It might have been six, but by that point you start forgetting what the first ones you saw that day were.
GP:::dannytheleigh:::random:::@destroeye No offence taken, I like mods.

FB:::quikcrit:::DIRECT:::We Need to Talk About Kevin (out 21 Oct). Lynne Ramsey laces her breathless impressionism with touches of the gaudy grotesque. Brilliant

GP:::quikcrit:::random:::The Terminator (1984/nth time). It occurs to me: this is really a western, isn't it? Or a western in reverse (dismantling of America)
FB:::quikcrit:::DIRECT:::Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984/nth time). Takes me back to faux-ripping hearts out in the school playground. Good times

TW:::quikcrit:::The Great Dictator (1940). Love it when the classics are as good as rumoured. I will only shave to Brahms from now on
GP:::quikcrit:::random:::Omen III: The Final Conflict (1981). Weird, haughty Sam Neill performance. Tried a bit too hard with the Satanic fatalities
FB:::quikcrit:::GROUP:::The Dilemma (2011). Contorted requiem for the American Dream flashes through Vince Vaughn's eyes as they sink into his ballooning cheeks
TW:::quikcrit:::House of Games (1987). Mamet beds the con flick in lost desires, parapraxes, psychological silt. Lets slip a little misogyny of his own, too
GP:::quikcrit:::random:::Future segment in Adam Curtis doc RT @guardiannews Syrian lesbian blogger is revealed conclusively to be a married man http://t.co/WVIA4Bt

TW:::quikcrit:::Ju-On: The Grudge (2001). Dinky structure gives kaleidoscopic purview on house of terror: not quite as concentrated as Ringu
GP:::quikcrit:::random:::Visitor Q (2001). Still on the Miike. Simultaneously the most subversive and the most conservative film I have ever seen
FB:::quikcrit:::DIRECT:::Welcome to Dongmakgol (2005). Grenade in a granary makes popcorn: Korean war drama's tactics charm, then lead to sentiment carpet-bombing
TW:::quikcrit:::Young Thugs: Nostalgia (1998). Takashi Miike's Stand By Me. With added casual domestic violence. And a broomstick up someone's arse
GP:::quikcrit:::random:::Black Swan (out 21 Jan) Apart from some hokey dialogue, Aronofsky makes a breakthrough. Red Shoes-spawned, but the dancer is the focus
FB:::quikcrit:::GROUP:::The Disappearance of Alice Creed (2009). Sleek-faced Martin Compston, the real leading lady here, dances on J Blakeson's sixpence twists
TW:::quikcrit:::The Sting (1973). AKA the loneliness of the long-distance conman. Efficient, brittle, but not the Newman-Redford love-in I'd expected
GP:::quikcrit:::random:::Bridesmaids (out 24 June). Formulaic, but got the basics down, from broad coemdy (extended diarrhoea skits) to well-embroidered characters
FB:::quikcrit:::WALL:::Me, getting all up in a tizz for Comment Is Free about The Flaw and the post-credit crunch wave of documentaries http://bit.ly/jYPx0r

FB:::quikcrit:::GROUP:::Let the Right One In (2008). The vampire mythos put at the service (brilliantly so) of something emotionally honest: the roots of violence
TW:::quikcrit:::Heartbreaker (2010). Romain Duris's "tears" have the potential to be the new Blue Steel, before bad last-act cave-in to romcom convention
GP:::quikcrit:::random:::Due Date (2010). Well-written, with a sour edge, but too bitter to hook audience. Downey Jr possibly miscast?
FB:::quikcrit:::WALL:::Russian Ark (2002). Unblinking crawl through the Hermitage/the bowels of Russian modernity. Like swallowing a copy of War and Peace whole
TW:::quikcrit:::Gozu (2003). Bull-headed demon, lactation fetish, woman birthing fully grown man. Miike's shockers too sparsely situated this time though
GP:::quikcrit:::random:::Black Book (2006). Verhoeven tries to comment on the Holocaust *and* have a scene in which someone mistakes a hidden gun for an erection
