Andrew_Pulver: @baronronan Tragically, I've left town so have missed it. We'll just have to wait for Mr Jonathan Romney of the IoS to pronounce...
Andrew_Pulver: Couple of reviews of fantastic Berlin #films: Salt of Life http://bit.ly/g6w70D and Cave of Forgotten Dreams http://bit.ly/fQpucD

Andrew_Pulver: If you're sick of the #baftas, here's a review of Wim Wenders' PINA at #berlinfilmfest: http://bit.ly/hBgstf
Andrew_Pulver: Herzog v Wenders, smackdown of the 3D art docos at #berlinfilmfest ... and Herzog wins in a walk. Cave of Forgotten Dreams is stunning
Andrew_Pulver: Baftas 2011: Live blog http://t.co/i6CitG7 via @guardian
Andrew_Pulver: Bit of a travesty with best foreign #bafta - I Am Love was my pick, and I suspect Peter B's was Of Gods and Men. But money talks etc
Andrew_Pulver: Most surprising revelation from Harry Belafonte #film Sing Your Song: Petula Clark, civil rights hero. Who knew?
Andrew_Pulver: Black Power Mixtape #film - how did the Swedes do such a great job documenting Harlem in the 70s?
Andrew_Pulver: Yesterday #film was Devil's Double - Dominic Cooper channelling mid-80s George Michael - except for the horrible killing of course
Andrew_Pulver: And got out of the fourth #film of the day, Salt of Life - followup to Mid-August Lunch... and it's just as sweet and funny
Andrew_Pulver: Screened this morning in Berlin - #film review of Margin Call http://bit.ly/gqPoV3
Andrew_Pulver: Just got out of Margin Call Ð best bit was Jeremy Irons's CJ moment: "It wasn't brains that got me here."
Andrew_Pulver: Berlin freezing cold, dark and rainy this morning - just like in my dreams
Andrew_Pulver: Been in Berlin for 24 hours and can't shake that Christiane F feeling. Wonder if it's the low-level street lighting.
Andrew_Pulver: @AnneBillson I felt, on mature consideration, it was time to get with the programme. What's Belgium like?
Andrew_Pulver: Finally made it to #berlinfilmfest! Opening film is True Grit - but it's all been said already, hasn't it? http://bit.ly/grlz96

AnneBillson: @DegenerateBoy Sorry, but no. There are few enough female roles in films as it is, so no way am I going to cast a guy in a woman's role.
AnneBillson: Milady de Winter - Jessica Hynes or Katherine Parkinson or Sally Philips or Tamsin Greig or Doon Mackichan? Maybe they could ALL have roles?
AnneBillson: @TheMichaelMoran Ah yes HER: http://t.co/FadLJpdR Oh, now I don't know who to cast as Milady.
AnneBillson: @chrisbrooke That's me. Ideally I'd like to go to bed later and later until it comes round full circle. I have a 25 or 26 hour bodyclock.
AnneBillson: @sharksarecool There's nothing to stop us having rival productions of The Three Musketeers. Hollywood does that sort of thing all the time.
AnneBillson: @TheMichaelMoran Oh Lord, I've never even heard of Doon Mackichan. Have I been missing out?
AnneBillson: @drewtrain Hmmm, I actually don't find Walliams very funny. Never a fan of Little Britain.
AnneBillson: @chrisbrooke I quite like the idea of that. It would just be like living in Scandinavia.
AnneBillson: Milady de Winter - Jessica Hynes or Katherine Parkinson or Sally Philips or Tamsin Greig? Or someone else?
AnneBillson: Chris Morris as Richlieu! (ta @TheMichaelMoran) Noel Fielding as Rochefort! Chris O'Dowd as D'Artagnan? or have we lost him to Hollywood?
AnneBillson: @TheMichaelMoran Squeals of pleasure at the very thought.
AnneBillson: @iambags Ooh yes, please do let me know if it's worth seeking out.
AnneBillson: I love this having-an-extra-hour lark. What's to stop us putting the clocks back every weekend? (Other than turning up late for everything.)
AnneBillson: Still dreaming about GARTH MARENGHI'S THREE MUSKETEERS, with Richard Ayoade, Matt Berry and Matthew Holness in the title roles. Make it so.
AnneBillson: @specialdelia Pixie is too cute to be real. (So is @frankiemcginty)
AnneBillson: @simon1972 I only grew up there 1955-1968! Left when I was 13. Lived in Rivermead Rd, nr County Hall. I went to Bradley Rowe, then Maynard.
AnneBillson: Axe-wielding bird ATTACKS! and WINS! http://t.co/A3OVYM1d (thanks @BelgianWaffling)
AnneBillson: @iPilates I wish it were a Halloween mask. She's starting to look like Rondo Hatton.
AnneBillson: @KaiMerriott And Johnny Hallyday. When I saw him in trailer for a Johnnie To film set in Hong Kong, honestly thought he was a Chinese actor.
AnneBillson: @KaiMerriott We must pray she has seen footage of Faye Dunaway & won't end up like that. Though fear she's on her way. http://t.co/QVjj6tnG
AnneBillson: @iPilates I wish it were a Halloween mask. She's starting to look like Rondo Hatton.
AnneBillson: @KaiMerriott And Johnny Hallyday. When I saw him in trailer for a Johnnie To film set in Hong Kong, honestly thought he was a Chinese actor.
AnneBillson: @KaiMerriott We must pray she has seen footage of Faye Dunaway & won't end up like that. Though fear she's on her way. http://t.co/QVjj6tnG
AnneBillson: @ronportnoir Sad. One of the most beautiful women in films. And she had the bone structure to age beautifully. Makes me angry (not at her).
AnneBillson: I've just lacquered my nails (fingers & toes) with Chanel's Peridot: http://t.co/JcsqzQ4q It's gold, but with an interesting greenish tinge.
AnneBillson: @KaiMerriott Lovely bit of onomatopoeia there!
AnneBillson: @ronportnoir Have you seen footage of Faye Dunaway at Cannes? Tragic. Really depressing. http://t.co/QVjj6tnG
AnneBillson: @KaiMerriott I find it rather distracting! Go on, Nicole, wrinkle that brow! You know you can do it!
AnneBillson: @Fintalloneword One of my favourite Bogarde performances. Vitti is kind of miscast, but still gorgeous. Won't say any more for now. Enjoy!
AnneBillson: @Fintalloneword Though perhaps it looks better and more intriguing now, with some of the period details, than it ever did at the time.
AnneBillson: @Fintalloneword Oh lord, not sure you should expect too much from Modesty Blaise - I saw (and loved) it at a very impressionable age!
AnneBillson: @nrm1972 I agree. But definitely has to be taken as the culmination of the rest of the film. It all builds up to that one moment.
AnneBillson: RABBIT HOLE. Oh gawd, another bereavement drama. Same old stuff. Nicole Kidman tries valiantly to move her eyebrows in a semblance of grief.
AnneBillson: @Fintalloneword I just found Evan Rachel Wood implausible - not the character herself, but her actions & reactions. Just a plot device.
AnneBillson: @robotnic Thanks for the offer but no, it was about a non-political detail.
AnneBillson: @simon1972 Surely not the central library in Castle Street?
AnneBillson: @BlackHoleMovies Yes! For emotional upset caused. Lasting damage and all that.
AnneBillson: Anyone in the USA seen The Ides of March? I'd like to ask a question about an important plot point. Spoilers involved, so would need to DM.
AnneBillson: Can't see why, if people love the Tintin movie so much, they feel a need to read reviews & get miffed when reviewers don't share their love.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender The movie. I understand why people love it; nevertheless they seem to be queueing up to berate reviewers who don't.
AnneBillson: Another shameless Halloween plug for my two-part blog about what I think are the SCARY BITS in movies: http://t.co/9KlzQGIn
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender I think I'm just sad that something so beautiful (and the books ARE beautiful) could be reduced to something so (to me) ugly.
AnneBillson: Once got cross with a friend's little sister b/c she insisted on watching Mr Pastry (on HER family's TV, mind) and I wanted to watch Batman.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender ha! not sure the front row is the best place for 3-D. But I sit there anyway - with luck the loud folk will sit further back.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender Did prefer look of Avatar - not aesthetically, but at least it wasn't trying to pass for human. I liked the exotic plantlife.
AnneBillson: Belgian trailer for DRIVE one of the most spoilerish I've ever seen: every plot development, every bit of action is in there, plus ending.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender Plastic that admits it's plastic is fine - it's fakery that looks naff. Maybe if mo-cap could learn to be true to itself...
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender Main problem with mo-cap is it's trying to be something it's not (ie live action). Like plastic trying to be wood...
AnneBillson: @Roblord Jesus, talk about madonna & whore. Thought the story might have been more interesting from Mulligan's p of v. But she was a cypher.
AnneBillson: @Roblord I did love the opening, with the clever use of the baseball commentary & everything. All the more disappointing afterwards.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender True I'm down on mo-cap - but only b/c it's neither fish nor fowl. Chases would have been more fun either live or animated.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender It's clear Tintin film has done its job & people love it. But still can't see why they think reviewers should love it too.
AnneBillson: @Roblord I was disappointed in Drive. Expected something way more Melville/Walter Hill-ish. Gosling gives same performance in Ides of March.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender But tweeted about that last week after seeing it. Found film passably entertaining (if ugly) but have already forgotten it.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender Maybe anti-Hollywood, I can't see the anti-Americanism. Personally I find it hard to get past the ugliness of the animation.
AnneBillson: Liking the sound of the yoga course which gives the directions, "...traverser la place Jourdan, NE PAS S'ARRæTER POUR MANGER DES FRITES..."
AnneBillson: @JStro_ @filmfan1971 She has an interesting screen presence, and I'm glad she seems all of a sudden to be getting higher profile roles.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender @dandouglas Also Michael Douglas is perfectly cast. Film not without its melancholy streak (which I think is an advantage).
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender @dandouglas You need to not be allergic to McConaughey. (But I'm not, so I'm usually fine with him.)
AnneBillson: @dandouglas @johnwarrender She IS delightful - maybe having the career LiLo threw away. Love her throaty Debra Wingerish voice.
AnneBillson: Can't see why, if people love the Tintin movie so much, they feel a need to read reviews & get miffed when reviewers don't share their love.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender The movie. I understand why people love it; nevertheless they seem to be queueing up to berate reviewers who don't.
AnneBillson: Can't see why, if people love Tintin so much, they feel a need to read reviews of it & then get miffed when reviewers don't share the love.
AnneBillson: @SongWarmonger I never saw The Camomile Lawn, but quite a few people here seem to have really liked her in it.
AnneBillson: @Andygedd0n I've been working my way through the beer menu of my local bar; realised at some point they were getting stronger and stronger.
AnneBillson: @FilmFan1971 I actually prefer her to Winslet, whom I have started to find mannered and predictable. Maybe she needs a splashy leading role?
AnneBillson: @theangrymick I like her "Sometimes I pretend to be other people".
AnneBillson: @j_christley "Beatific" really is the word for it, isn't it.
AnneBillson: @ericvanbuskirk @catvincent Wonder why Ehle is suddenly getting high-profile Hollywood work. Maybe because of The King's Speech?
AnneBillson: @DarkEyeSocket I think what I liked best was I didn't have a CLUE what was going to happen at any given moment. Just bonkers.
AnneBillson: @DarkEyeSocket That is not a guy you would want to have sex with.
AnneBillson: @GarethAveyard We might have had to call you cuntface.
AnneBillson: @catvincent Never saw Camomile Lawn. Lot of milky-white breasted wenches in it, were there?
AnneBillson: @catvincent She really only has one brief-ish scene in The Ides of March. And not vital to the plot or anything. But she really sells it.
AnneBillson: @DarkEyeSocket I love it when he makes us watch people walking across fields or sand dune for age and AGES. Always makes me want to giggle.
AnneBillson: @DarkEyeSocket Guy reminded me of Killer Bob in Twin Peaks. Girl had the sort of face (not conventionally pretty) you could look at all day.
AnneBillson: Glad to see Jennifer Ehle is getting decent roles in films like Contagion & The Ides of March. She was always my favourite Elizabeth Bennet.
AnneBillson: @GarethAveyard Are you sure they were pills? I once almost swallowed what I thought were large pills, but which turned out to be pessaries.
AnneBillson: @JoeCunningham14 Didn't like him much in Green Lantern, but then I didn't like anything in that. Loved him (& Anna Faris!) in Just Friends.
AnneBillson: @BinaryDad Scores high as big budget version of old-fashioned thrill-a-minute serials, which was what it set out to be. But not beyond that.
AnneBillson: @DarkEyeSocket Saw Hors Satan yesterday. What a riot! Like Bruno Dumont's version of a Stephen King story. Nodded off, but still loved it.
AnneBillson: @DavidForre Ouch! Hope you didn't break anything.
AnneBillson: @JoeCunningham14 Oooh must check out Chaos Theory. I like the other two. Heck, I even like him in Van Wilder.
AnneBillson: @rock_0la Dammit. I want some vodka now. Probably just as well I don't have any. Might have a single malt nightcap though...
AnneBillson: @jamescappio The cherry and raspberry flavours remind me of the fizzy pop I used to enjoy as a kid.
AnneBillson: @bryankam And there was me thinking beer was just beer. No wonder a couple of Quintines knocked me out.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender @dandouglas Think I liked GoGP much more than you. And loathed The Invention of Lying more as well. But agree re Emma Stone.
AnneBillson: @Andygedd0n And yet it's one I've not taken much notice of before now! I'm going to have to start taking strength into account, I think.
AnneBillson: @DavidForre Only recently I've started to take notice of alcohol content. If I'm going out for more than one I really should pace myself.
AnneBillson: @rock_0la That sounds daft. If I'm going to drink 41% alcohol I'd rather be drinking a nice vodka.
AnneBillson: @Andygedd0n There's a beer here called Scotch Silly, but it's only 7.80% (only!) http://t.co/Z0SG9Mvn
AnneBillson: @jamescappio Lots here at 12%. The ones with fruit are all about 3%, though they're best drunk in hot weather, apparently.
AnneBillson: @icelandbob There are lots of Belgian beers which are 12%...
AnneBillson: @JoeCunningham14 I like watching him (though think I prefer Reynolds). But I swear he gives the same performance in those two films...
AnneBillson: No wonder I get drunk quickly when drinking Duvel; at 8.50% it's almost twice the strength of Jupiler Blue (3.30%) or Hoegaarden Wit (4.90%)
AnneBillson: This Evening's Adventure in Belgian Beer: GOUDEN CAROLUS HOPSINJOOR: http://t.co/RuLsgajk Not bad, though maybe not my favourite so far.
AnneBillson: @NooseandGibbet Oh gawd I remember that. It was a low point in his career. One of many.
AnneBillson: THE IDES OF MARCH: I had problems getting past certain rather silly plot developments I can't even BEGIN to go into, for fear of spoilering.
AnneBillson: @NooseandGibbet Hmmm that's more like it. Though I reckon he was giving a proper performance in Heat, but just coasting through Ronin.
AnneBillson: HORS SATAN: my theory that this is Dumont's Stephen King movie is bolstered by the leading man looking uncannily like Bob from Twin Peaks.
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender @dandouglas Also Michael Douglas is perfectly cast. Film not without its melancholy streak (which I think is an advantage).
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender @dandouglas You need to not be allergic to McConaughey. (But I'm not, so I'm usually fine with him.)
AnneBillson: @dandouglas @johnwarrender She IS delightful - maybe having the career LiLo threw away. Love her throaty Debra Wingerish voice.
AnneBillson: @NooseandGibbet But - and this is crucial - was De Niro giving the SAME performance in both Taxi Driver and R & B? Gosling IS, I swear.
AnneBillson: @dandouglas @johnwarrender Plus wasn't even into Emma Stone when I saw it - but I am now! I may even have to watch it again because of her.
AnneBillson: @dandouglas @johnwarrender I rather enjoyed Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, though like all rom-coms it descends into slush in the final reel.
AnneBillson: What I'd really like to see is a mash-up of THE IDES OF MARCH & DRIVE. Ryan Gosling is giving the same performance in both films, after all.
AnneBillson: @alessadark Fabulous! (But so expensive!) I must try and swing by there during the next Brighton con, take a look.
AnneBillson: @craigeastman And I wasn't even fat! Probably just average brother behaviour. (I probably got off lightly - he never hit me or anything.)
AnneBillson: @craigeastman And when I saw that scene in Hudson Hawk it made me think of my brother calling me a fat pig when I was little...
AnneBillson: @johnwarrender @Gally_Freya @daisyhellcakes EUROPE'S LARGEST SCREEN? I'm envious. And understand why you wept when you saw wrecking ball.
AnneBillson: @Jonesvision @annodracula That's OK, one can't say "Night of the Demon is fantastic" too many times, as far as I'm concerned.
AnneBillson: @Gally_Freya @daisyhellcakes Gosh yes, Sleeping Beauty made a HUGE impression on me, more than Snow White or Wizard of Oz.
AnneBillson: @FriNightClinic I watch Kiss Me Deadly on TV at a ridiculously early age. God knows what my parents were thinking. But glad I did.
AnneBillson: @FriNightClinic second film down! http://t.co/9KlzQGIn
AnneBillson: Reminded it's Halloween so maybe time to link once again to SCARY BITS PART 1 http://t.co/9KlzQGIn & SCARY BITS PART 2 http://t.co/DkTQo30j
AnneBillson: @FriNightClinic Spookiest film EVER!
AnneBillson: @Fintalloneword It's my favourite Joseph Losey film! But I realise I'm in a minority there. Got terrible reviews, but I always loved it.
AnneBillson: @SiFoulaReel Haven't seen Help! for ages and ages - really must look at it again. I remember preferring it to A Hard Day's Night.
AnneBillson: @RoberttaWatson Oh, please do let me know if you come across a good one. Not a Spanish-speaker, but I'd like to hear anyway.
AnneBillson: 24 hours since I climbed the 387 steps to the top of the south tower of Notre Dame & now my legs have belatedly started to protest about it.
AnneBillson: My "Star Wars" films probably The Charge of the Light Brigade, Modesty Blaise and Help! + TV Night of the Demon, Kiss Me Deadly, Innocents.
AnneBillson: @daisyhellcakes @Fintalloneword Yes I agree. No actually not re Star Wars which I find quite inept - I much prefer Empire Strikes Back.
AnneBillson: @Gally_Freya @daisyhellcakes Today's kids spoilt for choice! Wish Ghibli & Pixar hd been around when I was small & it was Disney or nothing.
AnneBillson: @AnnoDracula But definitely Night of the Demon, The Innocents and Kiss Me Deadly from television.
AnneBillson: @AnnoDracula Trying to think of my own Formative Movies: maybe Charge of the Light Brigade, Help!, Modesty Blaise, Goldfinger...
AnneBillson: @daisyhellcakes "The Swingin' Boomlet" - THAT is what I shall call it from now on!
AnneBillson: @daisyhellcakes @Gally_Freya I'll never forget the intro to Mad Max 2, when screen opens out from narrow ratio to FUCKING GREAT WIDESCREEN.
AnneBillson: @daisyhellcakes I wonder what generation mine is. Just after the big Post-War wave of Baby Boomers. Post-Post-War Baby Boomer, perhaps.
AnneBillson: @daisyhellcakes "Gen X clearly most insufferable of all generations." You've nailed it. Didn't realise they were Gen X; am bit hazy on gens.
AnneBillson: @Gally_Freya @daisyhellcakes So true. Lost count of films I've recommended to pals who then watch them on tiny laptop screens and say meh.
AnneBillson: @fredhogge Me too! Don't forget to stock up on chewing-gum for the plane to LA - flying with blocked-up nose and ears can be horrid.
AnneBillson: @bad_medisin I was around 30 then, so little wonder I preferred the scarier, more satirical film...
AnneBillson: @daisyhellcakes That particular generation gets very uppity if you start criticising any of their favourite films. More so than others.
AnneBillson: @bad_medisin I preferred Gremlins to Ghostbusters. They came out around the same time.
AnneBillson: Whenever WOULD YOU LIKE TO SWING ON A STAR? came on the radio my brother used to join in with the pig lyrics & make oinking noises at me.
AnneBillson: @BobCoupee Bemuses me that Star Wars generation seems louder than others in defence of beloved films that impressed them in their childhood.
AnneBillson: @paul_haine @catvincent @jstckr @fumangoo Ah yes, Connery's last decent performance.
AnneBillson: @AnnoDracula Interesting that the Best Loved Movies from that era (Star Wars and after) were all quite regressive.
AnneBillson: @AnnoDracula Suspect if one had seen Raiders at a certain age it would be The Best Movie Ever Made. Like Star Wars.
AnneBillson: @BinaryDad Scores high as big budget version of old-fashioned thrill-a-minute serials, which was what it set out to be. But not beyond that.
AnneBillson: @jstckr @paul_haine @mattleys Mine lasted! It was a thing of beauty.
AnneBillson: @paul_haine @jstckr @mattleys I agree - wish I still had mine (which was stolen). Prefer it to nano I have now (though small size is useful)
AnneBillson: @jstckr The stupid squealing female lead (now Mrs Spielberg, of course) was SUCH a disappointment after Karen Allen.
AnneBillson: @bad_medisin I'm with you there. But I think Star Wars was a lot of people's First Exciting Cinema Experience & they will hear no ill of it.
AnneBillson: @hannahswiv I would rather have Raiders than Star Wars anyday.
AnneBillson: @bowendesign @jstckr @fumangoo @paul_haine Yup, controversial! I liked the heart-ripping but recall thinking oh, that's not family-friendly.
AnneBillson: @jstckr Interesting. And interesting you liked 2 least - I remember finding it very mean-spirited and xenophobic in a way Raiders wasn't.
AnneBillson: @thirstygargoyle Fabulous turn of phrase!
AnneBillson: Interesting proposal by @jstckr @fumangoo @paul_haine LAST CRUSADE is better than RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. To do with the age one saw it?
AnneBillson: Films I find fun, OK or bof, but that Folk Younger than Me Think are GREAT: Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Grease, The Breakfast Club.
AnneBillson: @paul_haine Haven't seen Last Crusade since it came out. I guess if it was on TV or an aeroplane I might tune in.
AnneBillson: @MhairiMcF Hey, it's only a personal opinion. Not saying I expect everyone to agree.
AnneBillson: @brionykidd It's really sad. That's the worst case of A-list celebrity cosmetic-surgery-itis I've seen. Poor woman.
AnneBillson: May I commit heresy? I don't think RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was that great. Entertaining, thrilling and really good fun, yes. But not GREAT.
AnneBillson: WHY, Faye, WHY? This is heartbreaking - a Hollywood tragedy: http://t.co/ljiN6gEr

JasonCritic: Jeez, there are an awful lot of films at the moment - ergo, a lot of awful films. A few gems, tho: Drive, Tinker, Woody, Johnny English
JasonCritic: @PeterBradshaw1 was on fire recording @filmweekly with me today. Verbally, not literally. That's silly. And dangerous. Me, I was smokin'...
JasonCritic: @TimD87 have done so Tim and will let you know if he responds. Thanks - altho it is sad news, by the look
JasonCritic: Facing arrest, Lars VT says: "I have realized that I do not possess the skills to express myself unequivocally" - what are your films then?
JasonCritic: @HannahJMcGill which? the Penguins or ETernal Sunshine - both have snowscapes...
JasonCritic: @MTw1tter you can be in both worlds, but one is laced with haters, where the other is nothing but positive vibes and love...
JasonCritic: @HannahJMcGill well, better that than Mr Popper's Penguins.
JasonCritic: @HannahJMcGill inexplicable

JasonCritic: My new podcast has Cline Sciamma on Tomboy, David Mackenzie on You Instead, @xanbrooks on reviews -  http://t.co/TKOVFCM0 via @guardian
JasonCritic: @catherinebray yeah, and, like, the TV series never had Julio Iglesias doing La Mer over the climax....
JasonCritic: ok - I now see why Scarlett Johansson is trending - just hope John Barrowman isn't trending for the same reasons? I dare not look...
JasonCritic: @catherinebray it's totally worth it
JasonCritic: @GeorgeHBone if he was in a British film, yes. If Fassbender was in an Irish film, then grand, but he was shining in British cinema, so...
JasonCritic: ok - sorry - appears I did label Fassbender erroneously -  i should have said 'British-based' acting talent in that one sentence.
JasonCritic: @jacques_aih i think we're tapering off now....
JasonCritic: in other news, Gael Clichy can sod right off
JasonCritic: btw - at no point did I say Michael Fassbender was British - I said he was Irish raised, German born and mentioned he was in British films
JasonCritic: @jacques_aih and if you ran one nearer to the British Museum, would you call it Holeburn?
JasonCritic: sorry if i sent weird messages out  - think i was hacked - thanks to all who pointed this out...and apologies
JasonCritic: Nick Hewer from Apprentice is at critics' show of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. I might be fired...
JasonCritic: @ShentonStage all sounds rosy there then
JasonCritic: @adamrubins @EthanRunt @brendonconnelly back Ali?
JasonCritic: @iandickens xan missed boonmee, not I. And I saw Anatolia in Cannes. Anyway, I hear Faust wasn't all that, but I never trust other critics.
JasonCritic: @huppert77 i actually got a mwah mwah kiss and got glared at by her publicist - she smiled and said "c'est normal, non?" I need a lie down.
JasonCritic: @iandickens top man - hotels are cheapest 250 euros, so I feel their pain - but imagine a football reporter missing the World Cup final...?
JasonCritic: @HelenLOVEFiLM missed you in Venice you know - your brand of chic and love of a bellini would have done the Lido proud...
JasonCritic: Look - Venice coverage wasn't Anglo-centric - Brit films were the talking point - if French or Chilean had been strong, I'd have told you
JasonCritic: to those moaning that I wasn't at Venice for the whole thing and missed Faust - whinge at the newspapers who can't afford to keep us there
JasonCritic: @KermodeMovie I am glad you're having a bath on Monday before going a-ranting round the country- it's sweaty work so best to start off clean
JasonCritic: My reviews round-up from #Venice68 film festival: Britain's big splash at the Lido http://t.co/UoCk5PE via @guardian

JasonCritic: My podcast: Venice films - Monica Bellucci, Todd Solondz, Abi Morgan, reviews w @xanbrooks @lesliefelperin http://t.co/gpaO17o via @guardian
JasonCritic: bet Faust was pretty awesome - Russian film The Return won Venice a few years  ago and that was great, and Sokoruv is a class act
JasonCritic: am watching it live on raimovie.it -but it's over now,...
JasonCritic: sokurov's Venice acceptance speech in Russian is as drawn out as his films tend to be, but he sounds beautiful, as his fllms tend to look..
JasonCritic: fuck a duck - I never saw Faust by Sokurov and it's gone and won the Golden Lion at Venice...
JasonCritic: loved TerraFerma by Crialese - good Jury Prize
JasonCritic: oooh I predicted that best actress venice win for Deanie Yip from A Simple Life in my review piece for Observer tomorrow....
JasonCritic: @chuckmcduck do keep those of us not there in the loop old boy....

JasonCritic: Hoop Dreams, has to be the saddest doc ever #emotionalmovies
JasonCritic: @michaelhogan @prodnose shall we move discreetly on to lunch, unless elevensies inspires #rockandrollbiscuits ?
JasonCritic: @michaelhogan @prodnose Weird Alpen Yankowicz? sorry -  #rockandrollbreakfastcereals
JasonCritic: Shame is awesome, Tinker Tailor outstanding - how to pick a Golden Lion "winner" between them? I'm going Tinker #venice
JasonCritic: @wendyide screening 1130am today but worth schlepping to Giorgione tomorrow night - nothing else really on then (apart from dinner with me)

JasonCritic: My review of Contagion from #venice - buy The Observer tomorrow for so much more :  gu.com/p/3xjy6/tw
JasonCritic: @XanBrooks ta mate .... I hear Harvey's after you for your Madge roasting...avoid canals
JasonCritic: Look, they didn't aks me - they just whacked 4 stars on my Contagion review! It should be 3 stars, of course...
JasonCritic: @davemorrissey64 even without Marcel the monkey, Dustin H or big budget, Contagion can take on Outbreak..
JasonCritic: @davemorrissey64 it doesn't have Marcel the monkey, or quite that budget, but it's fun...
JasonCritic: I love Elliott Gould
JasonCritic: @davecalhoun those benalynnis last night are hurting my head this morning...
JasonCritic: Just done great i/v w Fred Wiseman - his doc on Paris nude chic niteclub Crazy Horse is great and will be at LFF #venice
JasonCritic: Bad vibe on Contagion is spreading -  it's not a festival film but it is a silly genre film and therefore fun...
JasonCritic: @jacob_99 Alps? Or Contagion? Alps is very tough film to enjoy or understand. It gnaws at you.
JasonCritic: The grief squad from Alps would be overworked
 by Contagion - films make strange bedfellows #venice68
JasonCritic: spread it: Contagion - slick, silly digi disaster movie, good cast barking orders and facts. don't dip into the nuts, don't cough. #venice68
JasonCritic: Hear what I've been doing in Venice with a lovely Chinese man and @xanbrooks http://t.co/jMwRWCn via @guardian
JasonCritic: If you are seeing Kill List today, listen to its director and star first here to get in the mood http://t.co/jMwRWCn via @guardian
JasonCritic: @HannahJMcGill nice weather and too much grappa last night. Saw Greek film Yorgos Lanthimos. Now that was proper weird.
JasonCritic: @HannahJMcGill it's just very weird but also good and stuff
JasonCritic: Just had coffee with the Moor of Venice himself, Laurence Fishburne..#venice68
JasonCritic: @david_t_cox lou ye
JasonCritic: @david_t_cox i tink so too
JasonCritic: keira knightley will take all criticism on the chin... good on you girl, if it helps, I think you get better every film  #venice68
JasonCritic: @The_Shiznit course Smith can't do action - he does inaction from the look of him
JasonCritic: @boydhilton yeah - Razzies ahoy
JasonCritic: I liked Cronenberg's cold, sexy A Dangerous Method: Keira in Freudian slips, Fassbender great #venezia68
JasonCritic: Madonna's movie not all terrible. Some of it is, tho not perfs #venice68
JasonCritic: Waiting for Madonna film to begin...Carnage was ok, bit like theatre for me though #venice68
JasonCritic: so I'm off to have dinner with George Clooney and Ryan Gosling - I'll send them your love, of course. #venice68
JasonCritic: Clooney's Ides a great start to #venice - smart, grown-up, political  movie, Ryan Gosling fab.
JasonCritic: I have grown my hair to avoid confusion with Clooney this year #venice

PaulMac: @archiebland momentary error of judgment. But had seen the first one and it wasn't the same thing at all
PaulMac: The worst bit was that the most common response in the cinema was laughter.
PaulMac: It just exists so that it can serve up 40 minutes of degrading acts of violence and show people puking shit.
PaulMac: WHY I DIDN"T LIKE H CENTI 2 (sort of at request of @archiebland). It lacks any humanity. It also lacks even a scintilla of dramatic tension
PaulMac: @archiebland no i didn't like it. No sarcasm. But i didn't say why...
PaulMac: @archiebland shall i tweet my actual opinion?
PaulMac: I also went to see the new Footloose. Now THAT is a film. Well, it's a bit naff but it does have a great White Stripes dance scene

PaulMac: @thewarmjets I believe that specific action affects change. So do the protesters. I think there's an aversion to overt leadership tho
PaulMac: Uk uncut was smart cos it was based on an idea and a constructive goal; today saving nhs segued too quick into broader, more nebulous ideas
PaulMac: Really respect the protesters, their energy and compassion, but aims are too diffuse, contradictory in places #blockthebridge
PaulMac: Realise now it's #blockthebridge. Hashtag inconsistency will not bring the required political change

Phelimo: @AnnoDracula @klimny @Film4FrightFest @david_t_cox_  went to get the picture corrected, then to dinner as I'd missed too much, came back.
Phelimo: Off to Frightfest all-nighter, includes the UK public premiere of Human Centipede 2. Let's see how it goes down with its target audience.
Phelimo: As a child I never wrote in to Jimmy Saville's tv show, couldn't see the point, it was clearly all a fix.
Phelimo: Halloween Animation: There ain't no Halloween party like a Betty Boop Halloween party (pre Hays code): http://t.co/XQzOKFaS
Phelimo: My Halloween roundup of new horror DVDs: http://t.co/6ZFll9rB
Phelimo: I'm not watching the Creation documentary because, baby, I lived it! Well, lived near it. Some of it.
Phelimo: Halloween Arthouse: If you thought The Entity wasn't creepy enough, watch this take on it in the dark: http://t.co/rTDfaotP
Phelimo: @westonfront Kudos.
Phelimo: @lornajaggard I've heard nothing about season two being aired yet, the piece I'm doing is tying in with S1 DVD release (excellent extras).
Phelimo: @hayleycampbelly @dylanwynowen But is it fact or fiction?: http://t.co/PnZTWzxd
Phelimo: @AlanRouge It's a quite excellent Finnish horror film about the REAL Father Christmas.
Phelimo: Rare Exports on Blu-ray, interviewing Community's Dan Harmon, then Alice Cooper talking about horror movies at the NFT. Busy, busy, Friday.
Phelimo: @ccfage Yep, you can't go wrong with a Harryhausen exhibition.
Phelimo: @ccfage I've been to a few, is there a new one?
Phelimo: @ccfage I went to Harryhausen's 90th birthday do last year, was amazing: http://t.co/AxacvHlM
Phelimo: @ccfage It's a bloody great soundtrack, good call. x
Phelimo: Cheeses Christ: http://t.co/U8AFinDb
Phelimo: @klimny You can just make out The Great Pumpkin in that shot.
Phelimo: @SongWarmonger The positioning of corpses is the least of the movie's problems, I'm sad to say.
Phelimo: @AnneBillson One of my favourites too, Anne.
Phelimo: The prequel to The Thing was unacceptable. Really not good enough.
Phelimo: @ManMadeMoon He neglects to mention that it's utter shit.
Phelimo: Also, seeing The Thing tonight, prequel to the 1982 classic. To prepare I shall be first watching John Carpenter's The Thing...backwards!
Phelimo: @edgarwright It helps if you read all Tweets in the voice Adam Buxton uses to read Youtube comments.
Phelimo: will be seeing Hold Kiss Kill play at the Queen Of Hoxton tonight. Come and check 'em out, onstage 9.30, free entry before 8, then 3 quid.
Phelimo: Moby. Moby. Moby. Moby. Michael Stipe. Moby. Moby.: http://t.co/I2Ekn0FN
Phelimo: @ManMadeMoon @GavRov It's great that that's what you're looking at in that pic, NERDS! x
Phelimo: Was among the last to leave the Forum last night, not done that it a while, thank you Charlotte Hatherley. Now kindly fix my aching brain.
Phelimo: Off to see Charlotte Hatherley with her backing band Ash at the Forum.
Phelimo: Good to see Adam Buxton doing his great Youtube comments routine on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, he does loads of that at his BUG! nights, :P
Phelimo: The Onion on the Q-Awards, brilliant: http://t.co/byMpLD8K
Phelimo: X-Factor/Rhythmix name pinching: charity shouldn't have to spend one second or one penny on this shit, they got more honorable things to do.
Phelimo: The Q Awards, it's like the Razzies but for the music industry, right? That's the only way the choice of winners makes any sense.
Phelimo: Most people can't sing, most celebrities can't dance (or be called celebrities). This info can cut out about 30 hrs of shit telly per week.
Phelimo: More horror movie watching tonight: The Woman, Pieces, Maniac Cop. A good spread.
Phelimo: Halloween starts early for the Blu-ray reviewer: Quatermass And The Pit, Stake Land and Mimic: The Director's Cut tonight.
Phelimo: Catch you on the Flipside: http://t.co/FwZMoqLM
Phelimo: The Walking Dead, back on tonight: http://t.co/fssUArX9
Phelimo: @orangewarrior @AnneBillson It's one of those things, like Logan's Run, where doing it right would mean casting kids/unknowns. Impossible.
Phelimo: @orangewarrior @AnneBillson I did, quite like the look of it, not a bad idea (sticking several existing ideas together) for a movie.
Phelimo: @AnneBillson @orangewarrior He's 27 so the film will be about a gang of losers who haven't grown up, he's too old for it to make sense.
Phelimo: @orangewarrior @AnneBillson Such dumb casting: "Who can we get with experience in riding futuristic motorbikes?"
Phelimo: @alexispetridis Love Bobby G using the word "baby", at his age it's uncertain if he's referring to his girlfriend, wife or one of the kids.
Phelimo: @GavRov Love these, I'm sure I only glanced at them years ago and assumed it was yet another case of someone ripping off the great Foss.
Phelimo: Honestly, I've not been this excited since I had dinner with the bass player from Einsturzende Neubauten.
Phelimo: Getting ready to interview a Sheffield music legend from one of my all time favourite bands, have reverted to excited teenager mode.
Phelimo: If you've an iPad and love making spaceship noises then get the animoog app, big fat Moog sounds for only 69p (should be around 20 quid)!
Phelimo: @dysonjeremy Have you seen this short Bebe Barron scored for her friend Anais Nin: http://t.co/mAggmQCO
Phelimo: Smart move from Ash, putting a guy onstage to remind @Chazhatherley how to behave: http://t.co/ejQBN8OL
Phelimo: There's a new, hilarious How Did This Get Made? up, still the only podcast worth a damn: http://t.co/sXukFmIa
Phelimo: @westonfront Normally I'd agree, but it sounded fine on youtube, 586, Age Of Consent, Love Vigilantes, that's a proper New Order set.
Phelimo: A legendary Manchester band who changed the face of music with their original and inventive sound have reformed. Great, i love New Order!
Phelimo: @paulmcevoy Up yours! x
Phelimo: Well, they sure sound like New Order: http://t.co/HMm1tHbK
Phelimo: @GdnFilmandMusic Gibbons is responsible for my favourite ever Beatles cover version: http://t.co/3QH8pogP
Phelimo: @ManMadeMoon I remember seeing that knocking about the set, ironic so much time and effort spent to make it look "used" when it wasn't.
Phelimo: Moving out day is getting ever closer. Let me know of any flats/shares/whatevers going in that London.
Phelimo: @davoverse You should be able to DM me now.
Phelimo: More people you don't expect to ever see in the same room: The Leather Nun and (briefly) Stephen Fry: http://t.co/4js6pieg
Phelimo: Sooty, Sweep, Soo and Jilted John "They're iconic, aren't they? What does that mean?": http://t.co/oEb84PDZ
Phelimo: @AnneBillson Kasabian do, rather hilariously.
Phelimo: @davoverse Fixed that now.
Phelimo: @davoverse Yep, still looking.
Phelimo: @moc_moc_a_moc It looks pretty good, the sound is amazing. Extras are ok, mostly old on set stuff Zoetrope made plus a few new interviews.
Phelimo: @shanesthesia Glenn Gregory did Suspicious Minds, only Boy George  mentioned that Gary Glitter was on the BEF album.
Phelimo: Rounding off the weekend with a coupla Coppola's: The Outsiders and The Conversation on Blu-ray. And relax.
Phelimo: @klimny It's still half and half, which is great as you never know quite where they're going with it.
Phelimo: Having seen four of the new episodes of The Walking Dead I can happily confirm that the new season is going to tear you a new one.
Phelimo: BEF night was a bit of a cheesy all-star karaoke, apart from Green Gartside who was incredible!
Phelimo: B.E.F's 1st gig with vocals by G. Gartside, K. Wilde, Midge, Andy Bell, Boy George, etc. If stage collapses we could lose the entire 1980's.
Phelimo: Look what's on bloody telly: http://t.co/baSVRjIO
Phelimo: Heaven 17 had slap bass, synthesised brass, a keytar, syndrums, these things should always be in style. Stunning version of Being Boiled.
Phelimo: @nrm1972 It's a match made in Camden.
Phelimo: Heaven 17 gig at the Roundhouse tonight is in 3-D sound! Will I have to wear glasses on my ears?
Phelimo: My DJ set isn't obscure, it's hardly full of French electro-pop versions of old Dead Can Dance b-sides. Ok, maybe one: http://t.co/UcKCeByX
Phelimo: Looking forward to seeing The Heaven Seventeen at the Roundhouse tonight (still not seen Johnny Zhivago, The Humpers or Goggly Gogol yet).
Phelimo: @AnneBillson I've not had them myself, but they are clearly the most popular chicken byproducts.
Phelimo: @bbiillll Hi Bill, yes, I could do that.
Phelimo: Off to see Moneyball. It's about a ball of money.
Phelimo: @edgarwright Also,at 2.15, didn't the sandpeople use those sticks too? Prop is made from same type of drain pipe as used in Star Wars.
Phelimo: Warning: May contain scenes of hugging and dads: http://t.co/zCi67jVM
Phelimo: @AnneBillson And how often do they produce Mcnuggets and twizzlers?
Phelimo: Blu-ray of Touch Of Evil has 4 versions, two cuts x two aspect ratios. Just deciding on which version to watch will take some time.
Phelimo: Watched Candyman on Blu-ray. No frills but Philip Glass score is stupendous and Tony Todd has a BIG voice.
Phelimo: My "retro" mobile phone you all laugh at is currently better than your twatty Blackberry (yes, I know it won't last, enjoying the moment).
Phelimo: Dammit, got to move out and quite soon. Let me know of any flats/shares/whatevers going in that London.
Phelimo: Gumby/Google: Art Clokey's (RIP) birthday, Rick Baker, Phil Tippett, etc, worked at his studio on their way to the top: http://t.co/YGII1Cog
Phelimo: @andynyman "oh, and don't pay child support for any kids you have then deny they're even yours by pretending to be sterile."
Phelimo: I see dEUS are playing Koko tonight. I'd better go to that then.
Phelimo: Off to see the Felt/Denim/Go Kart Mozart documentary Lawrence Of Belgravia. Cannot bloomin' wait.
Phelimo: Was sent a box of power bars and weight-gain drinks as promo for the Spartacus DVD. Weight-gain drink really is the last thing I need...
Phelimo: @HughKDavid Some minor print damage but generally excellent, seems to be uncut (only saw it once before, at the Scala years ago).
Phelimo: Watching Maniac Cop on Blu-ray. I'm glad such an item exists.
Phelimo: Senna: http://t.co/wuIK2ttj
Phelimo: @johnwarrender I don't download illegally (don't know how and seldom need to anyway) so not seen season 2, dying to though.
Phelimo: @johnwarrender I never blame the show, it's amazing, but it does seem to be getting a rough ride over here.
Phelimo: @johnwarrender They are supposed to, but nothing on the review discs, very poor show.
Phelimo: Tried to watch the Community season 1 DVD, but Sony's check discs are unwatchably poor. Finished copies better not be like this. Grrrrr!
Phelimo: Real Steel's designer must have read comics: I liked the robot that looked like ROM and the one that was Mongrel crossed with Hammerstein.
Phelimo: Experimental film doc, Free Radicals, at the NFT followed by Jackman's  boxing robot movie at IMAX. Worried they may cancel each other out.
Phelimo: Great infomercial spoofs (involving David Cross) that were shown in the US at 4am alongside real infomercials: http://t.co/qqbqo6OO
Phelimo: Not that any sane person needs another reason to not watch The X-Factor, but they really are being dicks over this Rhythmix issue.
Phelimo: @nrm1972 Thanks, Neil, I am currently checking out The Big Picture site, good work.
Phelimo: @AnneBillson Thanks, Anne. x
Phelimo: @AndrewMaleMojo Jeez, what a pointless and badly researched segment: Eno produced Bowie's Berlin albums? Since when?
Phelimo: @AnneBillson @AndrewMaleMojo Six cassettes, that's enough for a book.
Phelimo: The Tree Of Life on Blu-ray, unsurprisingly it looks and sounds amazing (well the Doug Trumbull bit does, can't be arsed with Pitt/Penn).
Phelimo: @AnneBillson Arrow are usually pretty good at getting their movies right, they do well by Argento and Fulci. We shall see.
Phelimo: @AnneBillson Arrow have a 19-movie Russ Meyer collection coming out end of this month, no details on aspect ratios yet.
Phelimo: @DavidJesudason One of my all time faves, good choice.
Phelimo: Watched both versions of Cape Fear on Blu-ray. '91 is a fun watch but '62 is the winner (looks and sounds crisp and clear on BD too).
Phelimo: Watched the second of the new episodes of The Walking Dead. Damn, this new season is hardcore!
Phelimo: @GavRov It seems to still be very much in the conceptual stage at the moment.
Phelimo: @GavRov Not seen the Chris Foss artwork before.
Phelimo: @GavRov Nice, although it's Nick Allder and Brian Johnson in those pics, not Martin Bower. So there.
Phelimo: Excellent pice by The Office's Mindy Kaling on "Flick Chicks" : http://t.co/WlWEzsP5
Phelimo: @ccfage This is why you can't have nice things.
Phelimo: After watching the BFI's vintage Public Information Films, I'm now terrified of playing with matches, talking to strangers and the 1970's.
Phelimo: Watching the next BFI collection of spooky old Central Office Of Information films. If you don't click then you're just a clunker.
Phelimo: @lornajaggard Most, if not all, things aren't as good as Firefly.
Phelimo: @Ryan_Man2 It will now have a happier ending.
Phelimo: Watched The Walking Dead season 2 episode 1. It does not disappoint in the slightest, what a comeback! Whoa!
Phelimo: The only podcast worth listening to: discussing Punisher: War Zone with fab guests Patton Oswalt and Lexi Alexander: http://t.co/oxE64HGg
Phelimo: Terra Nova: Nowhere near as bad as Falling Skies. Or Torchwood. Or Outcasts, etc. In fact it's pretty good: http://t.co/dcGR9Srs
Phelimo: Nescafe coffee now has some stupid pull-tab seal, no more foil one to satisfyingly puncture with a finger. Changing brands now.
Phelimo: @yo_damo Loved it. Muggeridge and Cleese were spot on too, Gilliam didn't really get the look or accent perfect but nailed the giggle.
Phelimo: @GavRov Nice that the dog doesn't bother with it when there's no one around, it's more a game it can play with people than a replacement.
Phelimo: @WillyDean @lisamarkwell Some sort of space cheese.
Phelimo: Watching the three hour version of Senna on Blu-ray, perfect Sunday afternoon fodder.
Phelimo: Wondering if I can review this Story Of Film episode with the sound down, that bloody voice is intolerable, can only do 3mins at a time.
Phelimo: @alicelowe http://t.co/3zy3FGW4
Phelimo: Discovered that the length of time it takes to defrost a freezer depends entirely on what size hammer you use.
Phelimo: @AdamsLaura It makes a great double bill with Barbarella (but makes you want to see more films like that and there really aren't any).
Phelimo: @AdamsLaura One has to study the classics. Is there no entry exam at the BFI then?
Phelimo: @AdamsLaura Next you'll be telling me you've never seen Danger: Diabolik!
Phelimo: I'm going to brave the weather to go to the butchers. Need meat now
Phelimo: @Ryan_Man2 Played I'm Not Like Everybody Else when I Dj-ed at Leeds Fest recently, loads of people asked who did it. Should be better known.
Phelimo: @ScottScream Yep, really well paced and put together (plus he was the first Beatle I ever met).
Phelimo: George Harrison: Living In The Material World, a lovely documentary: http://t.co/yyUOI1IB
Phelimo: @edgarwright BIG DEAL! Dick Van Dyke did some CGI for Diagnosis Murder at home on his own dime: http://t.co/KP6G9C2i
Phelimo: @julianstockton @djcox Worth a try, imagine if she turned up...
Phelimo: @WillyDean All Diet On The Western Front.
Phelimo: @julianstockton @GavRov I like that Gav had to ask if it was still on. x
Phelimo: I've seen it countless times, only had it on in the background to check picture and extras, the end of `Silent Running STILL made me cry.
Phelimo: @AnneBillson On film maybe, but he is pals with Xenu.
Phelimo: Watching the Silent Running Blu-ray, picture is sharp enough to read all the graphics on the sets and costumes, so that's what I'm doing.
Phelimo: @edgarwright  Went there in '77, saw the Superman set on the 007 stage, shot a splurge gun, touched the Iron Mole from At The Earth's Core.
Phelimo: BBC's Rex Appeal: great dinosaur clips but some shitty research, plus at least two of the talking heads deserve a slap.
Phelimo: Wow, just saw the AMAZING booklet that comes with Eureka's Silent Running Blu-Ray, so many pics I have never seen before. + I get a mention!
Phelimo: @westonfront I'd swap KO for Infotainment.
Phelimo: @GavRov See you there. x
Phelimo: @GavRov Lovely, though technically there were two models: the front-on view was a forced-perspective half body: http://t.co/EF4loMmv
Phelimo: @edgarwright @Criterion Was Videodrome number 12?
Phelimo: @ManMadeMoon Some of it is quite catchy: http://t.co/Ahmmqzei
Phelimo: @ManMadeMoon *SPOILER* Turns out the Devil did it.
Phelimo: @gemmaaddy I think the show is quite fairly split three ways, 'though she did edge forward for season three.
Phelimo: @Mangofruitloop October 15th I think. It's really well done.
Phelimo: Watched BBC's Holy Flying Circus comedy drama about Life Of Brian. Funny and playfully executed, casting director NAILED IT, perfectly cast.
Phelimo: Fringe. It's bloody great and back on UK telly tonight: http://t.co/RgUuV9Oh
Phelimo: @dysonjeremy It's a disgrace what they did to his work on The Wolfman, a crime even.
Phelimo: This weather is DISGUSTING!
Phelimo: Looking for an Eric Roberts fantasy art lunchbox? Then look no further (also a fab Gran Torino in cartoon form one): http://t.co/AzzBJC5r
Phelimo: I'm seeing Hold Kiss Kill at the Bull&Gate tonight and so should you:  http://t.co/rRBfF6Cv
Phelimo: @Dorianlynskey I spoke to her on a CB radio once, TRUE STORY!
Phelimo: In the 70's they oft aired this lovely cartoon in breaks for Kid's shows, sung by, of all people, Ronnie James Dio! : http://t.co/Oskz5H1m
Phelimo: @yungkha As I recall from their press, that look is known as "totally Krossed out" (I knew that information would come in handy one day).
Phelimo: @AnneBillson You must listen to this, hilarious: http://t.co/lknbBs7P
Phelimo: @alicelowe I heard it's because it releases dolphins into your brain.
Phelimo: @unklerupert 10th October, there's a deluxe special edition with cd of unreleased tracks and book. Really well put together documentary.
Phelimo: Got that George Harrison doc on Blu-ray on again, it's just nice to have on in the background.
Phelimo: @westonfront At least you're not infested with Tribbles.
Phelimo: Svankmajer film was good, bit long perhaps but continually inventive visually and a story that went from silly to sad, great ending.
Phelimo: @unklerupert I quite like the trailer, nice to see something a bit more obscure that doesn't just give the whole film away in short form.
Phelimo: Really looking forward to seeing the new Jan Svankmajer film tonight: http://t.co/MLcJXWEJ
Phelimo: Watching the Blu-ray of Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. It has an Oshima, a Sakamoto, a Takeshi and a Bowie, that's good enough for a Sunday.
Phelimo: @ManMadeMoon Love Them! one of the few movies to have an exclamation mark in the title (along with Moon! and Source! Code!).
Phelimo: @AnneBillson That was the bit that made me sit up and take notice.
Phelimo: Went to what I thought was a 3-D movie about dolphins but was in fact a 3-D movie about amputees (which was better).
Phelimo: @StephenPKelly Nope, I had to go to the PR office to watch it.
Phelimo: Watched Doctor Who season finale, The Wedding Of River Song. You'll only find it complicated if your lips are moving while reading this.

Ryan_Man2: Dear fellow Lawrence-lovers, he's on Jarvis's 6 Music show today at 4pm http://t.co/aPJshYOf
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet Great minds, Ashley. Great minds :-)
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson Haven't seen London Blvd yet. Did you notice Quentin Curtis produced it?
Ryan_Man2: @Fintalloneword Haha! I often like him as an actor (except Leatherheads/The American). Just don't think he can direct for toffee.
Ryan_Man2: Beware "The Ides of March" http://t.co/awJ4LleJ
Ryan_Man2: "You cannot put pen to paper or finger to keyboard without confessing something" - Nancy Banks-Smith.
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Four words: I beg to differ. But self-doubt *is* an important and natural part of being creative.
Ryan_Man2: @filmigirl Will see it in 2D next week if possible though
Ryan_Man2: @filmigirl Aww thanks, unfortunately my B'wood column is on hold: I injured my eye over the summer; waiting for surgery so films at minimum.
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Oh no! You were into it at the weekend. Has it got much tougher?xx
Ryan_Man2: It's impossible to say this too many times: Clueless is a perfect movie. Watching it now on Film4.
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet Likewise! Might see you tmrw, though I'm eyeing that 9.15am start rather warily :-)
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie And there are still 5 hours and 7 minutes left. xx
Ryan_Man2: @catherineshoard I really feel with that headline that you've blossomed.
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson Yep, knocking me out for a few hrs. I knew your birthday was then,hurrah! Can't wait to wallow in that M.R. James after the op.
Ryan_Man2: I love that feeling when you've seen a film and you know you are going to be thinking it over for some time. In this case: Dreams of a Life.
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson well if I'm up and at 'em by then (surgery on 23 Nov you see) we must meet up, it's been waayyy too long x
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson I'm basically scared by everything, so I'm no judge. Hey, coming to London again soon?
Ryan_Man2: Every time I use my new taps I will think of Lawrence of Arabia. (That's my plumber's favourite film.)
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson I dunno, that's pretty scary. Imagine if the rapper hadn't washed his hands after recently touching Gwyneth Paltrow.
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson I'm basically scared by everything, so I'm no judge. Hey, coming to London again soon?
Ryan_Man2: Every time I use my new taps I will think of Lawrence of Arabia. (That's my plumber's favourite film.)
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson I dunno, that's pretty scary. Imagine if the rapper hadn't washed his hands after recently touching Gwyneth Paltrow.
Ryan_Man2: I would like to see the game changed to guarantee that derision awaited anyone using the phrase 'game-changer.'
Ryan_Man2: My interview with Paul Kelly, director of the wonderful Lawrence of Belgravia http://t.co/w33jGtNa
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet I'll be there. Should I bring hankies, then? Oh dear, I cry at everything.
Ryan_Man2: He also tells a heartbreaking story about the time he was duped into thinking his hero Lou Reed had written him a fan letter. #Lawrence
Ryan_Man2: ÒLove that one. HavenÕt heard it for about 20 years Ôcos my records have been in storage.Ó #Lawrence
Ryan_Man2: His links are brilliant: ÒThat was Care. They made three singles for Arista. They all bombed.Ó ÒSometimes itÕs better to lose, you know?Ó
Ryan_Man2: I've been listening to the radio show that Lawrence (Felt/Denim) records in Lawrence of Belgravia. Sweet & hilarious. http://t.co/1hREeZJd
Ryan_Man2: @sopharsogood Thanks. Between you & me I'd give The Ides of March and Crazy Stupid Love a swerve.
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson @edgarwright Vern's a fab writer! "WHO CAN KILL A CHILD is not actually a new reality show, itÕs a 1976 Spanish horror film."
Ryan_Man2: If you like Antonia Quirke, such a star on #Film2011, check out her superb, sparky radio column in @NewStatesman http://t.co/2tYazQDL
Ryan_Man2: @aftabamon the sacrifices you make for me, eh?
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Hooray! I'll be there in 90 mins... #ifonly
Ryan_Man2: @aftabamon If it's not 3D then YES :-)
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Oh boo-hoo, then I guess we'd never have forgiven you ;-)
Ryan_Man2: @aftabamon Come home! Where are you anyway? Chasing the lovely Freida around Doha?
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Now that's just teasing me. We were right there in your room and you wouldn't play it. Wahhhh. :-(
Ryan_Man2: "Pain is temporary. Film is forever" - what Michael Caton-Jones told Leonardo DiCaprio during the shooting of This Boy's Life.
Ryan_Man2: @dukemedia_uk I'm still sore at not being nominated for Blue Valentine.
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie I thought there was gonna be a video to go with it! I ripped your CD onto my laptop so will play that instead :-)
Ryan_Man2: Thanks to @sopharsogood for spotting that last example of The Wrong Ryan.
Ryan_Man2: Another instance of a reviewer writing Gilbey instead of Gosling: http://t.co/Agcr89dg (end para). Hope our bank accounts get mixed up next.
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet Haha thanks Ashley, felt like we didn't have time to mention all the dreadful stuff about it.
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Push one into your laptop! Oh you haven't seen Nacho Libre, when Jack Black passes the nun some toast under the door. So funny.xx
Ryan_Man2: I keep stopping what I'm doing to laugh at the memory of how bad #Anonymous was :-)
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Is it possible to pass maple leaf biscuits to the person you're Skype-ing with? Here's hoping... xx
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie We'll discuss this next time we speak. Prob not best suited to 140 characters! Is it to do with the course? xx
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson Have you seen Who Can Kill a Child?, which @edgarwright talks about here? http://t.co/CftRDLbf Sounds demented & brilliant.
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Watched the Picasso.. clip from the Prince Charming tour, it's so good.. Hope you;re having a great week xxx
Ryan_Man2: @tds153 Funny, I feel that about Clooney these days (especially in The American).But Gosling seems intriguingly amoral - though not in Ides.
Ryan_Man2: If Adam Buxton presents Never Mind the Buzzcocks every week I promise to never again be heard saying "It's shit without Simon Amstell."
Ryan_Man2: When I hear "rough-hewn" I get an image of Chris Huhne in my mind. Also, the words "Michael Gove" always make me envisage a burns victim.
Ryan_Man2: I pray they're filming these when Brandreth is out of the country. RT@mediaguardian Just a Minute on TV | Media Monkey http://t.co/SDo2ONoQ
Ryan_Man2: If you haven't had enough of people talking about Kevin, here's my review http://t.co/FY3VBBdt Warning: may contain Tildalove.
Ryan_Man2: My bank account balance is £0.07. This is the closest I will get to being James Bond.
Ryan_Man2: I wish George Clooney would stop directing films. He's a charismatic and good-looking actor. Can't he accept those limitations? #IdesOfMarch
Ryan_Man2: @tds153 My plan is to grow even taller so the weight doesn't show.
Ryan_Man2: At my pre-surgery assessment today, I discovered that I am half a stone heavier than I thought, but also 1 ? inches taller.
Ryan_Man2: "Pain is temporary. Film is forever" - what Michael Caton-Jones told Leonardo DiCaprio during the shooting of This Boy's Life.
Ryan_Man2: @filmdetail Indeed. That's what the @NewStatesman needs these days: some lengthy and delicious correspondence from major auteurs.
Ryan_Man2: "A film is never really good unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet" - Orson Welles. (thanks @filmdetail)
Ryan_Man2: @filmdetail Thank you so much for sending me that, what beautiful ideas eloquently expressed.
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet You just taught me the word 'lanyard.' You have earned the right to wear yours for an extra week.
Ryan_Man2: @GuyLodge Realised I haven't been following you- not deliberate, just forget to resume after Venice reviews blackout. Will you have me back?
Ryan_Man2: @Fintalloneword Not yet, was already looking fwd to it, now even more so! #fourthree
Ryan_Man2: @GuyLodge I *am* on that bench. Even though the wind is howling in our ears and we have chapped lips and chilblains, we're not budging.
Ryan_Man2: How good was Desert Island Discs w/ @Markgatiss (http://t.co/8VbysJOx)? I risked hypothermia staying in the bath to the end.And didn't care.
Ryan_Man2: @filmboyd You do. It's the law. Film critic law.
Ryan_Man2: Two of my favourite films of this year (Meek's Cutoff and Wuthering Heights) were shot in 4:3. Coincidence? I think not. #acertainratio
Ryan_Man2: So sleazy when people tweet about products hoping they'll get a free batch. Unless it's the Cov Garden Soup Co's Lentil & Smoked Bacon, obv.
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie That "nanny's birthday" tweet was Oakes-so-funny! xxx
Ryan_Man2: @louisebrealey Aww, that's sad to hear. I had to see Anonymous instead. Sounds like we both got a raw deal.
Ryan_Man2: @JamieDunnEsq Can't believe there's no Collected NBS. What a gap in the market.
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet There's *always* time for Cheers.
Ryan_Man2: Kept seeing adverts today, mostly for moisturers and suchlike, mentioning the 'fight against ageing.' But the fight against ageing is death.
Ryan_Man2: Not supposed to comment yet on Paul Kelly's #LFF doc Lawrence of Belgravia but will say Lawrence is a star. Dug out my Denim CDs when home.
Ryan_Man2: "I was sent to a special school to try to work out what my problems were. I think my problem was I knew what was coming" - Ray Davies.
Ryan_Man2: Watching Mike Leigh's 'Grief' is like being slowly and lovingly strangled by someone who only wants what's best for you. (I liked it, btw.)
Ryan_Man2: I'm on @BBCFrontRow at 7.15 tonight talking about Anonymous. Could the title be a reference to Roland Emmerich's directing style?
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie I bought you some mango too but when I got home it was still in my fridge :-(
Ryan_Man2: @sopharsogood haha that's like the third time that's happened.
Ryan_Man2: Lines you only hear on The Archers: "I'm going to put all this behind me and concentrate on British Sausage Week."
Ryan_Man2: Loved this film, and Lawrence. RT@Tim_Burgess Went to watch Lawrence of Belgravia tonight - Finally he'll be a big star!
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Thanks honey, we miss you and your room of awesomeness. See you very soon, and we'll Skype in the week xxx
Ryan_Man2: @curranradio @dukemedia_uk Double fail :-(  Things can only get better, indeed. #DReam
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet I will read it - once I've got round to writing mine! Just need to get this sex addiction under control first. #Shame
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet Lots of other work on so prob won't make any til Deep Blue Sea on Thurs.
Ryan_Man2: @dukemedia_uk & I say that as someone whose entire My Name Is Joe review called Peter Mullan 'Peter Curran' (lead singer of D:Ream) :-(
Ryan_Man2: @dukemedia_uk Looking good! Will have a proper nose around it soon, but did notice you've got Vincent Cassel in Tetro - shd be V Gallo.
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet Agreed, not to mention a great, rancid performance by Harold Pinter.
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie but then you're the Human Centipede generation. Nothing shocks you lot    :-(     xx
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie I dunno, I thought the guy getting done over in the park was pretty horrid.. and what happened to poor Jenny... #kids
Ryan_Man2: @RichTKelly Possibly with Joaquin's v/o! http://t.co/8iRBjx4d
Ryan_Man2: Incredible that Dark Blood, ft. River Phoenix's last (incomplete) work, is being released. I spoke to its producers: http://t.co/kxOoEHPz
Ryan_Man2: @JahOrDee I say we line up Funky Pigeon behind Moonpig and dispatch them both with one bullet.
Ryan_Man2: @JahOrDee Die, Moonpig, die!
Ryan_Man2: @AlexanderChow ...it has a great performance by a formerly comic actress as an abused wife - Olivia Colman (of Hot Fuzz & C4's Peep Show).
Ryan_Man2: @AlexanderChow  I don't think it's in the same class as NbM but I'm in the minority! But just like Kathy Burke in Nil by Mouth...

Ryan_Man2: @aftabamon I liked it. It's a bit TV but Freida and Riz are ace. Hope you';re having fun, man :-)
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie me too but he hasn't put it together in a film... yet! He also did Julien Donkey-Boy which is nearly as freakygood as Gummo.
Ryan_Man2: Going out now to see Trishna (of the d'Urbervilles).
Ryan_Man2: No fond memories of seeing #StoneRoses in 1995. The only time I've ever fallen asleep standing up. #bahhumbug
Ryan_Man2: The snottiness of the review by @TheOohTray of Lawrence of Belgravia is undermined by misspelling Bob Dylan (clue: he's not Matt's brother).
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Harmony Korine also had himself filmed provoking different strangers into beating him up in the street.
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Larry Clark's film Kids was written by Harmony Korine, who later wrote and directed... Gummo!
Ryan_Man2: My #background has faded into the #background.
Ryan_Man2: Lynne Ramsay planning a 'very modern' adaptation of a classic science-fiction novel?? Any guesses? (just heard on @BBCFrontRow )
Ryan_Man2: @AnneBillson a) me too b) it is! c) they drive me a bit nuts too but your piece today was superb! d) no way
Ryan_Man2: Bjork told Nicole Kidman not to work with LvT... Bogarde accused him of ruining cinema... amazing interview! http://t.co/aWxMIbkj
Ryan_Man2: Fantastic interview with Lars von Trier by @DrMatthewSweet on yesterday's Night Waves: http://t.co/aWxMIbkj
Ryan_Man2: @JahOrDee What are you doing buying all these children??
Ryan_Man2: @JahOrDee someone's got a student railcard...?
Ryan_Man2: @JamieDunnEsq Thanks Jamie, I shd have mentioned Brody, and annoyed I forgot the amazing James Wood. Must read some Kehr. #greatcritics
Ryan_Man2: @georgeeaton yr account may have been hacked- i got a msg from you saying "Bad blog going around about you, have you read it yet" and a link
Ryan_Man2: I feel spooked by the critics who complain that Sleeping Beauty isn't erotic. It's like moaning that you weren't turned on by The Accused.
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Glad you like it. Aw, you know what to get them for Xmas then. Or just buy them all straws and they can share your tea.xxx
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Just downloaded Skype but not sure how to use it yet - you can be our guinea pig in the week!xxx
Ryan_Man2: Eddie Mair very funny yesterday: "A recent survey shows that the average age of Radio 4 listeners is 'dead.'"
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie No hurry. And I forgot to give you your Fall CD. Next weekend. Very excited to see your digs! Have a great weekend xxx
Ryan_Man2: @DrMatthewSweet @tds153 And not even funny farmhouses.
Ryan_Man2: Tonight's Comic Strip best avoided sayeth @tds153. Maybe dig out old VHS of 5 Go Mad, Mr Jolly or the Rebecca pastiche Consuela instead.
Ryan_Man2: I was highly impressed by Sleeping Beauty, the first film by the novelist Julia Leigh: http://t.co/uOtqEs6M
Ryan_Man2: Heavy couple of days. Last night saw Kevin: Omen II. This morning, Steve McQueen's version of Sex & the City. #LFF
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie not as much as I miss you! ;-) xxxxx
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie If you hang around outside at midnight, a taxi might take you back to Koko on 12 October. Either that or you'll catch pneumonia.
Ryan_Man2: What do you want from a critic? http://t.co/MfDRhV0E (Yes I forgot James Wood, for which I will thrash myself with a rolled-up New Yorker).
Ryan_Man2: @dragonhistory Hi sweetie do listen to this before it's off the iPlayer on Sunday, v funny Archers sketch from 17.05: http://t.co/cGxDUPMK
Ryan_Man2: I liked that slip: "We are not people." Obviously he should have then torn off his 'face' to reveal the gleaming android beneath. #lab11
Ryan_Man2: Quick, mention the Olympics #lab11
Ryan_Man2: Bad enough that Ed's speech is interrupted by a technical fault at the BBC. But did they have to go to a *blue* screen? #lab11
Ryan_Man2: @joannanadin No. What's wrong is to regale family members with "hilarious" lines you just wrote. *hangs head in shame*
Ryan_Man2: @adlow76 Ha! Always good to start a movie with a funny scene, eh?
Ryan_Man2: @JamieDunnEsq Can't believe there's no Collected NBS. What a gap in the market.
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet There's *always* time for Cheers.
Ryan_Man2: Kept seeing adverts today, mostly for moisturers and suchlike, mentioning the 'fight against ageing.' But the fight against ageing is death.
Ryan_Man2: Not supposed to comment yet on Paul Kelly's #LFF doc Lawrence of Belgravia but will say Lawrence is a star. Dug out my Denim CDs when home.
Ryan_Man2: "I was sent to a special school to try to work out what my problems were. I think my problem was I knew what was coming" - Ray Davies.
Ryan_Man2: Watching Mike Leigh's 'Grief' is like being slowly and lovingly strangled by someone who only wants what's best for you. (I liked it, btw.)
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie True. Hope you're feeling better, sweetie. Cannae wait to see you! xxx
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Wooo! What time are you going to Camden?xxx
Ryan_Man2: @conanriquelme Ah, wasn't aware of that til now. Even if it stinks, which it may not, The Fall has bought him mucho credit with me.
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet Ah, apologies to @johntydon for misattributing great Tyrannosaur review :-)
Ryan_Man2: Again costume designer is the incomparable Eiko Ishioka (Bram Stoker's Dracula/ production designer on Mishima). Her work looks edible.
Ryan_Man2: Exciting that Tarsem Singh, director of the gorgeous fantasy The Fall, is back with Snow White. Pics here http://t.co/Xy94zv0d
Ryan_Man2: @PPlasticHelmet Nice Tyrannosaur review, Ashley. Not blind to its flaws, like some have been. Bugs me that for so many, 'tough' = true.
Ryan_Man2: @Mike_N5 Haha, that's the idea... (so long as you don't invoice me)
Ryan_Man2: Does 'Tyrannosaur' sentimentalise suffering? My review here: http://t.co/RmBgSu0p
Ryan_Man2: If I write more than three consecutive tweets in 15 mins, it usually means I have a shitload of writing to do and I'm procrastinating.
Ryan_Man2: @filmdetail @RichTKelly awesome! I hadn't seen that before.
Ryan_Man2: Goodbye #REM. We'll always have Hammersmith Odeon, May '89, & Milton Keynes, July '95. On second thoughts, you can have Milton Keynes back.
Ryan_Man2: @RichTKelly Yeah it was in his mad, raging journal from D&C. And isn't there some Zep in School of Rock?
Ryan_Man2: That was Richard Linklater when Robert Plant refused to allow a Led Zeppelin song in Dazed & Confused. (Page had said yes, though.)
Ryan_Man2: #SchoolOfRock is trending because I bought it from HMV for £3 last week. I rule.
Ryan_Man2: Scary that my followers are stuck at 666. Please everyone remember this tweet if I am decapitated by a sheet of glass while I sleep tonight.
Ryan_Man2: @mattjmueller don't worry Matt, they don't have crap voiceover there in real-life. Have a good trip! #Rio #EliteSquad
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Thanks, I can't believe you're camping out! xxx
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie That could be wrong. Or it could be right. #Rise
Ryan_Man2: So von Trier is quitting "all public statements and interviews"? At least he finished press for Melancholia first. Phew! #convenient
Ryan_Man2: @_AntRosie Put some flippin' ice on it! PS I have DM'd you xxx
Ryan_Man2: Don't be put off watching #FreshMeat tonight: it proves that you *can* continue the Fresh franchise without Julia McKenzie or Anton Rodgers.
Ryan_Man2: @tpaleyfilm Thanks, interesting stuff. I am vehemently against spoilers, but fact remains that they come largely from trailers not reviews.
Ryan_Man2: Please share in my love for Kathy Burke and Olivia Colman: http://t.co/SbtGS7Uk
Ryan_Man2: @Dorianlynskey Thanks Dorian!
Ryan_Man2: Funny: the complaints @XanBrooks is getting for revealing that the world ends in Melancholia, sthg revealed in the film's opening scene.
Ryan_Man2: Listen up: who's got any questions they want to ask Terrence Malick? (I'm not interviewing him, just wondered if you have any questions.)
Ryan_Man2: @sambaintv I think you can catch hepatitis like that.
Ryan_Man2: In the battle for a seat near the coffee shop plug sockets, there can be but three victors. Today, I am one. Be gone, surly IT freelancer.
Ryan_Man2: @CharlieEnglish1 I thought you were trying to start an online word association game. #wires
Ryan_Man2: @drgonzolives Glad it went well! I've been off with an eye injury(long story, detached iris, ouch)writing a bit while waiting for my op tho.
Ryan_Man2: @drgonzolives Haha, I was going fro a C+. Hey how did Edinburgh go?
Ryan_Man2: @FayebellineW Gambo and HSM? That's a killer combo
Ryan_Man2: It's so much that scene in LA Story where they're grading parking spaces.

chiggi: @valmcdermid I have a straight girl's crush on Chris Div*I*ne.
chiggi: @TWhittermarsh you shoulda come + seen us in Glasg  instead of the boring trouser guy. X
chiggi: @valmcdermid if it's good enough for dickens, it's good enough for val (tho' I look forward to your writing a *spontaneous* combustion)
chiggi: @lyngardner How exciting - I hear news of Tre Sorelle nel Bosco!
chiggi: I love a headline that says: Higgins becomes Irish president. It fuels my delusions of grandeur
chiggi: @valmcdermid Oh dear. Poor old Donna is a moribund septicaemia case, and I think a WPC will be found incinerated shortly. VERY CHEERY
chiggi: @janinegibson @stuartmillar159 I leave the country and LOOK what happens (have spent a day on Bute being heartily pissed on).

chiggi: In the Guardian's New York office where @AdamGabbatt has just made me a nice strong cup of Yorkshire tea. Sigh with contentment.
chiggi: @emilybell Vg. Intg tho how artists like Jeremy Deller are into banners etc as art, acting like curators to collect/re-present it
chiggi: His focus will be creative industries, creativity in the young, heritage, Olympics cultural legacy and libraries. @DanJarvisMP
chiggi: Bizarrely, in laying out his policy focus, shadow minister @DanJarvisMP doesn't mention arts. Is it a dirty word for Labour, or what?
chiggi: @emilybell HA! btw I have totally stolen your point abt OWS banners + have co-opted it into a thought about folk art...
chiggi: @SaraMohrPietsch Cos and Jaeger. Pretty smart for me. Thort I'd better style up in Manhattan

chiggi: The Portland vase. Oh glorious achievement. And I says as have NEVER liked jasperware.
chiggi: @ConductorPaul My dear, I have no doubt of it. Suffering for your art.
chiggi: @marktierney I was surprised to discover Etruria was a part of Italy, nay an ancient civilisation, as a child. I'd only heard of ours
chiggi: @marktierney Can you imagine seeing mass imports from China now & thinking, oh, we'll do that only better + cheaper here?
chiggi: @ConductorPaul Dear boy, the wonder is that you submitted to a Stoke coiffure. I expect it was cheap, though. Are you on tour on 6 Nov??
chiggi: @marktierney Basford! Home of the New Vic. Views of Etruria. Sigh. Oh look, clever Josiah...
chiggi: @louisebrealey it certainly is...

chiggi: An abiding wonder of collector-watching at #FAF11 is how, with so much money, one can let cosmetic surgery go so horribly wrong.
chiggi: @rognbrow I can't BELIEVE you tweeted that! Not fair!
chiggi: If you are an ordinary mortal, find affordable art at #FAF11 at MUSEUM EDITIONS (by R4). Lovely editions from not-for-profit galleries.

chiggi: @natashakwhiffin you won't have too long to wait - am sure our photographer's images will be on Gdn website afore long
chiggi: Tate Modern, Tacita Dean: in short, as unbombastic and thought-through as so much of her work. Oddly mesmerising.
chiggi: Sometimes the images are of fountains, the sea. Or abstract shapes relating to the Turbine Hall itself
chiggi: ... The screen's vertical edges have sprocket holes. It's like a filmstrip. Within, abundance of images. 'A visual poem'.

dannytheleigh: @RogerCrow thank you. thought the impression of me was a bit too loud though.
dannytheleigh: @tonypaulway Thanks - pleased you thought so.
dannytheleigh: @gracedent A single tear and a hushed "Bravo" as the credits began to roll.
dannytheleigh: Sad to see @PeterBradshaw1 and @robbiereviews being unkind about Human Centipede 2 despite both visibly being very moved during it. #fickle
dannytheleigh: @SnorkyO it's a fine film
dannytheleigh: @robbiereviews One copy of The Exorcist and directions to Radio 5 coming up....
dannytheleigh: @JoEvans3 Thank you, but sorry about Top Gun. Nobody's perfect.
dannytheleigh: @Rosswlg Only what you have. Thing about her is, she could film a random street corner in the drizzle and it would be fantastic.
dannytheleigh: @robbiereviews Stay pure. You wouldn't want to end up "outspoken, opinionated" and handing out BAFTAs.
dannytheleigh: @DrBecky74 Wouldn't risk a prediction vs them. I started supporting in 82 and told everyone I knew we were going to win the cup final 3-0
dannytheleigh: @DrBecky74 Not going but think Shame or The Kid With A Bike might win Best Film, and be nice to see Weekend win the Brit newcomer one.
dannytheleigh: @destroeye Probably. I could have said anything, not at my most coherent last night.
dannytheleigh: @tcArkell See what you're saying but I prefer the film to the book.
dannytheleigh: @SteveCran Thanks - it's like walking on the ledge of a very high building. (And occasionally falling off it).
dannytheleigh: @ParagraphFilms I can barely say the unridiculous ones at the moment.
dannytheleigh: @Rosswlg It's good isn't it? Lynne Ramsay's a very gifted woman.
dannytheleigh: @DrBecky74 Still wouldn't be as repulsive as John Terry though.
dannytheleigh: @bubbaboowee thanks - don't live in Brighton anymore but like the look of Zombiana
dannytheleigh: Began day talking to Cronenberg. Will end it talking abt Ides of March, Anonymous, Miss Bala. Film 2011, 11. 20. Will then talk to myself.
dannytheleigh: @WordsofColour Well, nuance is a famously tricky business in 140 characters. Or 2 minutes of live TV.
dannytheleigh: @WordsofColour ...but if that's what you think, that's what you think. 'Locked down' all round it seems.
dannytheleigh: @WordsofColour It's a little weird being (I think) accused of being a loudmouth/chauvinist when having (I thought) a civil exchange...
dannytheleigh: @WordsofColour But she WAS positive about it.
dannytheleigh: @WordsofColour Aspect of film I said was grotesque was equating problems of whites + blacks in 60s Deep South. Which it does.
dannytheleigh: @MarkECMorris OK down this way. If you're about let's try to fix up a visit (L obviously better at logistics than me).
dannytheleigh: @jj_dunning David Mellor, Dennis Waterman, Ken Bates, Kerry Dixon, Tony Banks, Damon Albarn... your boys took a hell of a beating...
dannytheleigh: @WordsofColour ... in terms of portrait of Deep South. Do take yr point, but what Stockett/Taylor doing really OK?
dannytheleigh: @WordsofColour Think equating Skeeter & Abeleine (as both book and film do) an awful choice to make. MB is flawed, sure, but much less so...
dannytheleigh: @rosstmiller Definitely - she has a TINY role in World Trade Center too, where she's pretty much much the best thing in it.
dannytheleigh: @JaneyLambert It might have been six, but by that point you start forgetting what the first ones you saw that day were.
dannytheleigh: @destroeye No offence taken, I like mods.
dannytheleigh: Saw five films yesterday, although only one featured a sterling turn from @tonypaulway
dannytheleigh: @rosstmiller Almost certainly yes. Though Viola Davis IS great.
dannytheleigh: @nick_duncalf @ClaudiaWinkle I wonder who I was thinking of with beetroot then? Johnny Vaughan? Onions recommended though - PIQUANT.
dannytheleigh: @MarkECMorris We did film one. Weird. How you?
dannytheleigh: @destroeye MOD? as in Quadrophenia?

dannytheleigh: (Despite wandering round Elephant & Castle lost in the rain beforehand).
dannytheleigh: Just back from fun @ScalaForever do. Nice atmosphere, memory lane stuff, good ideas for the future. ALSO: the Cinema Museum. It is fantastic
dannytheleigh: @stropchops That makes sense. I always mean to investigate him (Petty not Crowe), but there's only so many hours in a life...
dannytheleigh: @stropchops Stumped mate. God that looks bad though.
dannytheleigh: @ImCalledAdrian Claudia's had a baby, I've been in a storage facility.

dannytheleigh: @m_pattison @tpaleyfilm Kind of agree, distinction ref'd in piece (unless it's been subbed out) - but it'll be talked abt as a remake, so...
dannytheleigh: @_widdershins Agreed - not much he doesn't have an interesting slant on
dannytheleigh: @katiekitamura Did everyone survive the water tank?
dannytheleigh: @robbiereviews He wasn't naked either.

dannytheleigh: I'm going to see Kill List again at the weekend. See you there.
dannytheleigh: @cinetrix Time Zone got stuck on repeat on the malfunctioning CD player at my wedding party. Stopped being funny after half an hour.
dannytheleigh: @ScareSarah Ah, Barbara S...
dannytheleigh: @midnightcheese The bastards! Yup, was good, will be another time though I'm sure
dannytheleigh: Good times at the @ScalaForever dbl bill last night. Hope all who came enjoyed.
dannytheleigh: @davoverse excellent - there's a recent Criterion of Something Wild I think.
dannytheleigh: @DrBecky74 who'd have thought it eh?
dannytheleigh: @midnightcheese excellent, see you Sun
dannytheleigh: @midnightcheese Sunday night, starts at 7 - After Hours on first. (Following a bit of babble from me).
dannytheleigh: Written something about David Lynch, just for a change: http://t.co/Q4fFkQg
dannytheleigh: @Cervantes_ thanks. we shall see...
dannytheleigh: This Sunday, my dream dbl bill for @ScalaForever: Scorsese's AFTER HOURS & the marvellous SECONDS. It's at @Roxy_Bar_Screen. You're invited.
dannytheleigh: Happy Birthday @ultraculture. He doesn't know it but I'm jumping out of a cake later, dressed as Bunny Boy from Gummo.
dannytheleigh: @ultraculture I'll tell them you said that as they're escorting me away.
dannytheleigh: @robertmuir87 @tomsmovies @kill_list_movie It really is.
dannytheleigh: @ultraculture Sold out surely? You'll love it though.
dannytheleigh: Saw the trailer for @kill_list_movie tonight and realised how much I want to see it again already.
dannytheleigh: Back from rural Scotland. Witnessed a caber being tossed. Now disorientated, but pleased to find London still here.
dannytheleigh: The Big Dawg will not be pleased. RT @owenhatherley true fact: Tim Westwood is only one year younger than my Dad.
dannytheleigh: @Phil_on_Film I'm just going to go in at 7.30 for the last half hour.
dannytheleigh: @bovinemoo @V3ct0rv1ct0r @ultraculture Hope all well. Fire on Garratt Lane coincidental, wasn't it?
dannytheleigh: @tpaleyfilm Excellent - although if he was on form, I'm amazed you got a word in edgeways.
dannytheleigh: @robjessel Excellent, thank you
dannytheleigh: No, Bond Street is actually being closed for scheduled works.  Somehow I think that says it all.
dannytheleigh: Bond Street tube station being closed early. Surely not...? #mayfair
dannytheleigh: @ultraculture I'm going on other people's stuff myself Charlie. But think it's just the Junction that's been in real trouble.
dannytheleigh: @V3ct0rv1ct0r I know, a friend and her daughter are up on the 20th floor of Sudbury House as well. It's worrying. Sure will be OK though.
dannytheleigh: @V3ct0rv1ct0r Think it's OK our way. Northcote Rd/St Johns Road different story.
dannytheleigh: @madaboutvintage thanks, that's kind of you!
dannytheleigh: @Ogrizovic thanks
dannytheleigh: @Laura_Cheetham thanks for that
dannytheleigh: Conflicting rumours about the Southside. Anyone hear anything definitive? #wandsworth
dannytheleigh: The footage from Clapham Junction would be insane even if I didn't walk through there pretty much every day.
dannytheleigh: @stropchops What the hell, let's make it Sao Paolo. You lot OK down there?
dannytheleigh: Anyone want to join me in a quick chorus of Maybe It's Because I'm A Londoner?
dannytheleigh: @ashelem ello you. let's try and fix a get-together soon, yr nephew is very good value at the moment.
dannytheleigh: @bigred_smithy All about the chase scene
dannytheleigh: @_wheat Was in the same pile. Have you seen? It's... interesting. Ian Buchanan v funny & there is a wide-eyed blonde starlet called Betty...
dannytheleigh: RIP Poly Styrene
dannytheleigh: @midnightcheese I'd go with Gilda.
dannytheleigh: @cinecloud being (very) slowly coaxed out of it
dannytheleigh: Ah, heatwave London. What better chance for an hour long tube journey and a dental appointment in Shepherds Bush?
dannytheleigh: No matter how many chances I give it, this book is still failing to write itself.
dannytheleigh: @mr_wheatley Come down if you're around! Liked your horrors for the Film 4 website. Come and See & Threads - now THAT'S a double bill.
dannytheleigh: My 5 yr old son is singing Tinie Tempah. Apparently he's about to "bring the women and the cars and the cards out."
dannytheleigh: @skinmysunshine *drums fingers*
dannytheleigh: @skinmysunshine I know, I'm a bit slow sometimes
dannytheleigh: Big society, shrivelled economy. Never a better time to follow @paulmasonnews
dannytheleigh: @Phelimo I wouldn't be getting involved if not
dannytheleigh: @JOLovegrove that's the plan
dannytheleigh: The rest of the programme is at scalaforever.co.uk, and unspeakably good it is too.
dannytheleigh: Aug 21 IÕm presenting a double bill for @ScalaForever at the Roxy - AFTER HOURS & SECONDS. You should come. Will be fun. http://t.co/6VndGV1
dannytheleigh: @Phil_on_Film I did - they asked me for my dream double-bill and that was it. See you there!
dannytheleigh: @JOLovegrove October
dannytheleigh: @midnightcheese Shame - but come to the Scala thing. What's going on in Hamburg?
dannytheleigh: @KeithPeries Christmas I believe
dannytheleigh: Setting off for tonight's Raging Bull spectacular at York Hall. I'll be the one who isn't shadow boxing or playing a violin #whereisthenomad
dannytheleigh: @firstlightfund I do. They are: Barton Fink, Le Corbeau, Do The Right Thing, Kind Hearts and Coronets, Nil by Mouth, The Servant...
dannytheleigh: Ah, a gorgeously sunny Friday afternoon. What better time to write  about Tarkovsky & Fukushima? Me in the Guardian: http://bit.ly/i4Aqp6
dannytheleigh: @mr_wheatley Just emailed you!
dannytheleigh: FINALLY seen Kill List. It's very, very good. But aside from that, the less you know before seeing it the better. So I'll shut up about it.
dannytheleigh: my lawyers are on it RT @johnnield2 did Helen from #theapprentice nick her idea from "The Greatest Gift" by @dannytheleigh ?
dannytheleigh: Hm. The entire British power structure appears to be crumbling. Pretty average Sunday then.
dannytheleigh: Sad to hear Googie Withers has died, star of about half my favourite British films.
dannytheleigh: RT @JustDoItFilm If you don't know, TONIGHT is opening night of our UK cinema release @RitzyCinema 8:45pm
dannytheleigh: Been giving out prizes at the primary school where a friend of mine teaches. Glad I kept the jokes clean.
dannytheleigh: And tall. I forgot tall.
dannytheleigh: Just to add my voice to the @robbiereviews consensus - far too smart/funny/talented not to be back in action very soon.
dannytheleigh: Wow. You stumble out to Caffe Nero for an hour, and they close down the NOTW in your absence.
dannytheleigh: @ashelem Hopefully. Have had the staff prepare my tuxedo. Are you?
dannytheleigh: @Stuey_85 yes
dannytheleigh: pleased for @mr_wheatley that Kill List is getting such love after today's screening, if vexed that SW Trains unable to get me there myself
dannytheleigh: @thegreatsd hope it went well
dannytheleigh: Been a while since I felt quite this tempted to emigrate. #whatsfinlandlikethistimeofyear
dannytheleigh: @ultraculture Does "different screening strategy" mean showing a good film instead?
dannytheleigh: @manslashrobot @horatioalgar Great line. Haven't heard about a release, which is a drag.
dannytheleigh: @skinmysunshine Not nearly enough
dannytheleigh: @RealDaveB Yes, and yes.
dannytheleigh: @yannjones @holygrumble I speak very, very slowly in real life, they have me rigged up to electrodes on the programme.

quikcrit: @CarolineNo Not seen. Caro wants to. Good to hear, wasn't massively enthused myself
quikcrit: @CarolineNo Too true. Or, as they say in Chandanpur: 
???? ???? ????????? ??? ???? ????? ??
quikcrit: The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (2011). Too much violence. Tintin sure likes beating people up. Creepy smile.
quikcrit: Predator (1987/nth time) Not enough violence
quikcrit: @CarolineNo I know! I've no idea what they actually say!
quikcrit: ?????? ?? ???? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ????????? -- ?????? ?????????? ??? http://t.co/kjRfuZpW
quikcrit: In this week's After Hollywood: Abu Dhabi, Manchester City, djinn, cultural consultants and Matt Damon http://t.co/kjRfuZpW
quikcrit: @JoeKubrick To be honest, I'm not sure. Been away, so only caught the tail end of it...
quikcrit: Fascinating Tom Shone piece on youthful stars, how it's shaping acting styles, and why Hollywood is coming full circle http://t.co/nj36mmIq
quikcrit: Wuthering Heights (out 11 Nov). Coarse, dour, desperation-fuelled alternative to Bront romanticism. Very original, but hard to love
quikcrit: Trishna (2011). Michael Winterbottom is Mr Contemporary again with smart subcontinent Tess update Ð a sour riposte to Bollywood gloss
quikcrit: @kenjfuj Didn't feel like anything had much in the way of stakes, myself Ð felt all about the process, not the people
quikcrit: Contagion (2011). Another Wyndham-esque "cosy catastrophe", with globalised-era dressing. Snappy, but weirdly undramatic
quikcrit: The Artist (out 30 Dec). Refreshing tribute - light-footed with the irony - to Hollywood's silent era. A cinematic palette-cleanser
quikcrit: The Troll Hunter (2011). Nice B-movie buildup to the big boy in fun but not-too-bright found-footage tribute to Norwegian folklore
quikcrit: Submarine (2011). Less studied and Wes Anderson-esque, more heartfelt and elegiac than I expected
quikcrit: @L1Z_ADAMS That girl can fuck right off. And her gnome
quikcrit: Mon article sur Amlie et ses effets sur la scne internationale du box office (en anglais seulement Ð desol) http://t.co/X3WhEUsm
quikcrit: Me, being a curmudgeonly old bastard (apparently) about Amlie in this week's Guardian column http://t.co/X3WhEUsm
quikcrit: Amlie (2001/2nd time). Still touches my sick trigger. They should have made a whole movie out of the Tajikistan fantasy
quikcrit: She-Monkeys (out May). Lisa Aschan keeps one plotline tight, gives another jaunty comic rein in clipped but subversive riding-school story
quikcrit: Shame (out 13 Jan). Like Naked Gun next to Snowtown, but just as good. Fassbender entombed in his own handsomeness by McQueen
quikcrit: Andrew Pulver gives it up for the current British film crop in today's Guardian http://t.co/41M5LX59
quikcrit: @JoeKubrick I'm still reeling!
quikcrit: Snowtown (out 18 Nov) Crushing, unbearable, brilliant debut. Four walkouts tonight. Think Warp Films have their first masterpiece
quikcrit: Mi nuevo artculo sobre la popularidad de Don Gato en Mxico (en ingls solamente) http://t.co/ouDgFnnD
quikcrit: My new After Hollywood column on the strange popularity of Top Cat - aka Don Gato - in Mexico http://t.co/ouDgFnnD
quikcrit: Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 (out 21 Oct). Slickly curated overview of the civil-rights fight. Black Dynamite less funny in aftermath
quikcrit: Black Dynamite (2009). Connoisseur's blaxploitation spoof, down to over-eager camerawork, po-faced horniness, and authentically limp ending
quikcrit: Junkhearts (out 4 Nov). Eddie Marsan titanically vulnerable as an ex-soldier in London spiral of doom intuitively directed by Tinge Krishnan
quikcrit: ... on everyone's asses. Just to balance things out, about to write about a certain indisputable leader of a cat for next week's column
quikcrit: Getting the usual roasting on the comments thread in this week's After Hollywood. Serves me right for getting all psychohistorical ...
quikcrit: Les Bien-Aims (2011). Christophe Honor refines his modern musical model beyond the kitsch pastiche of Dans Paris into something emotional
quikcrit: Latest blog for the Guardian, on the rise of the Helvetica Blockbuster, Hollywood's answer to globalisation http://t.co/wZXJBQ3h
quikcrit: Neuilly Sa Mre! (2009) The French Fresh Prince of Bel Air, only on a Maghreb tip. Same multi-culti frothiness
quikcrit: ... French film (proportion understood: about two-thirds) ...
quikcrit: ... discovered the Berber video industry (lots of camel-mishap comedy, as far as I can see) ... paid for my first ever non-subtitled ...
quikcrit: Back from three weeks schlepping from Morocco to France. Film-related findings: met Jonathan Rhys Meyers' ex-manager...
quikcrit: @thom_dusch that is terrifying. i'm glad i wasn't there (though would have liked to have seen you guys)
quikcrit: Raajneeti (2010). Prakash Jha's cynical survey of Indian politics; tries for The Godfather, comes out more Dynasty. Points for ambition tho
quikcrit: Ip Man (2008). Nationalistic biopic of Bruce Lee's teacher. Donnie Yen actually not a bad actor: &gt; Jet Li (not saying much); &lt; Jackie Chan
quikcrit: Cracking roundup of 9/11 cinema by Peter Bradshaw. I would add Eugene Jarecki's Why We Fight to this list http://t.co/Ut1eEUz
quikcrit: More on lightening censorship and more freedom for film-makers in post-revolutionary Egypt http://t.co/2jamH94
quikcrit: Argh, looks like it's Difficult Third Film syndrome for my second favourite director http://t.co/XQZrfM2
quikcrit: ??????? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ?? ???? ??? (???? ???????? ???) http://t.co/18gyTir
quikcrit: Apropos of which, here's this week's After Hollywood: a two-year progress report on India's big boys, Reliance http://t.co/18gyTir
quikcrit: I want to write about things at the mass-culture level, not champion the little guys. Plenty of others doing that (and very well)
quikcrit: I'm trying not to get involved in ideology too much on the blog; it's more about observing the effect of geopolitics on entertainment
quikcrit: Much more politically motivated response by Indiewire's Anthony Kaufman to my Egypt blog last week http://t.co/OEkTRAU
quikcrit: Spider-Man 2 (2004/2nd time). Know it's rated as the series high point, but that dutiful story-arc feeling kicks in. First one had more zip
quikcrit: The Lady Eve (1941). "They say a moonlit deck is a woman's business office." What a line!
quikcrit: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (out 16 Sept). Oldman reigns over gallery of statuesque establishment wrecks in lugubrious end-of-empire piece
quikcrit: The only #KillList review I agree with so far - Charlotte Sullivan in the Standard http://t.co/YDtk1xp
quikcrit: When Africa Met China (out 7 Oct). On the "special relationship" between China and Zambia; a delicate eye on a gargantuan topic
quikcrit: Be careful what you wish for, and all that, but that sounds kinda fun
quikcrit: "...  may be endangering that investment. It's an experience that will definitely get your fullest attention.?" http://t.co/Wl9QO6K
quikcrit: "...  sixty or seventy million dollars in something and seems to be in the process of deciding that your creative input..."
quikcrit: Love this William Gibson quote on Hollywood: "You don't really get it until you're in a situation in which some entity has invested..."
quikcrit: Gonna be writing about India's Reliance Entertainment next week. Not a lot of people know this, but Cowboys and Aliens was part-Bollywood
quikcrit: In my limited but growing experience (3 films), Ajay Devgn is emerging as my favourite Bolly star: perpetually bad-tempered
quikcrit: Raajneeti (2010). Prakash Jha's cynical survey of Indian politics; tries for The Godfather, comes out more Dynasty. Points for ambition tho
quikcrit: Interesting Indy piece on film-making dodging Hollywood, and the on-going European "super-studio" project http://t.co/Z9Vi99j
quikcrit: Call me contrarian, but: the most disturbing thing about Kill List is fanboy blindness to a derivative last act that hobbles a good film
quikcrit: @JoeKubrick Thanks! Your stuff was very useful for the piece: looking forward to reading more.
quikcrit: In Google Translate I trust
quikcrit: That last tweet probably reads: 'My artichoke on eggplant cinnamon'. I'd love to be able to speak Arabic
quikcrit: ?????? ??? ??????? ??????? ??? ?????? -- ?? ????? ??????????? ??? http://t.co/ZLV75F4
quikcrit: This week's After Hollywood column, featuring Egypt, Ramadan, Tahrir, dictators and Planet of the Apes http://t.co/ZLV75F4
quikcrit: Cowboys and Aliens (2011). Horrible, sentimental script. Nervous direction. Terrible star part for a passive Daniel Craig
quikcrit: Lights in the Dusk (2006). Routine soothing Kaurismki miserablism and Nordic shot-design showcase: Buster Keaton invades an Ikea catalogue
quikcrit: The Grudge 2 (2006). Too quick to the scare after six films, but just as elegantly structured. Takashi Shimizu should have more of a career
quikcrit: Mon article pour The Guardian (en anglais) sur les films de BD franaises et belgiques en concurrence avec Hollywood http://t.co/RzKUFnu
quikcrit: My new After Hollywood (now on Tuesdays) about The Smurfs, and why Franco-Belgian comic adaptations are a good thing http://t.co/RzKUFnu
quikcrit: @oolopse I'm a bit more pro: some wonderful epiphanal moments, but got a bit loose, and the less said about the ending the better...
quikcrit: The Smurfs (2011). I survived (not as bad as advertised). Don't know why Smurfette was getting so much attention with Sofia Vergara around
quikcrit: Les Aventures Extraordinaires d'Adle Blanc-Sec (2010). Whimsical Gallic Indiana Jones-in-a-corset; meanders after the Egypt setpiece
quikcrit: We Need to Talk About Kevin (out 21 Oct). Lynne Ramsey laces her breathless impressionism with touches of the gaudy grotesque. Brilliant
quikcrit: 30 Minutes or Less (out 16 Sept). Danny McBride, and his Napoleon Dynamite-esque stoogery, rules over compact, spiky laugh-spree
quikcrit: Largo Winch (2008). Sharply plotted, linguistically fluent (English-French-Serbo-Croatian) stockmarket 007, based on the Belgian comics
quikcrit: Face/Off (1997/2nd time). The kind of star-centric, high-pomp mayhem endangered by CGI. Travolta-doing-Cage actually channels Jim Carrey
quikcrit: Apologies for appalling, machine-translated Portuguese in the last tweet. Just trying to get some Brazilians in the house
quikcrit: Meu novo artigo sobre Tropa de Elite 2 e os filmes de favela do Brasil (apenas em Ingls - desculpe!) http://t.co/25fSoQU
quikcrit: Got great material from around the world coming up in the next few columns. On the down side, I'm going to have to go and see The Smurfs
quikcrit: This week's After Hollywood column for the Guardian, on Elite Squad 2 and the favela films this time http://t.co/25fSoQU
quikcrit: 3 Idiots (2009). My second Bollywood; I am now an expert. India's highest grossing film. Aamir Khan (46) plays 20, and gets away with it
quikcrit: @mserinkelly "Very". In grammatical terms, it's the elative form
quikcrit: Jarhead (2005/2nd time). I'm a big fan normally, but I think Peter Saarsgard may have been miscast here. It's weirdly directionless
quikcrit: Me, yacking on about international box office, in "After Hollywood", my new column for The Guardian http://t.co/geSuOb2
quikcrit: A propos of shit, Laurent Cantet's The Class is the film we all should be watching
quikcrit: Dirty Harry (1971). Weaning off my summary justice fantasies. Wouldn't trust a "fed" with that haircut, though
quikcrit: @speccycol It's gotten so large I can actually barricade the front door with it
quikcrit: ... the time for hiding behind your DVD collection
quikcrit: Paul Andrew Williams' Cherry Tree Lane, a film I didn't especially like at the time, looking more on the money now. Not that this is...
quikcrit: Interesting (but rather hopeful) piece on the riots and Attack the Block http://t.co/j2o3VtA
quikcrit: Gran Torino (2008). In Sickness And In Health meets Dirty Harry meets Boyz N the Hood
quikcrit: Singham (2011). My first ever paid-for Bollywood. A radiant paean to police brutality: like Jack Bauer was Hindu and stuck in a 50s musical
quikcrit: Smart Anne Billson column on the rising tide of anachronistic language in films. That shit drives me nuts, too http://t.co/SkTJgNc
quikcrit: The Rite (2011). Dialogue-writing with all the subtlety of biblical exegesis. Anthony Hopkins takes to it like a man possessed
quikcrit: Red Riding Hood (out 15 April). It's a blood moon! Time for Gary Oldman's periodic villain schtick. Much scarier than soppy Twilight wolf
quikcrit: Deep End (1970/out 6 May). Fresh, satiric outsider's eye on Swinging London, more playful than Antonioni's. Gratuitously tragic ending, tho
quikcrit: Couscous (2007). Long, masticatory conversation scenes power involved breakdown of immigrant France - beurs and beyond
quikcrit: ... not something that interested Tim Burton 10 years ago, you have to say
quikcrit: Rise of the Planet of the Apes (11 Aug). Give a monkey a copy of Final Draft and eventually he'll write something thematically 'mature'...
quikcrit: Elite Squad: The Enemy Within (out 12 Aug). Jos Padilha's 10-year favela project takes on Brazilian politics, aiming for The Wire's hubris
quikcrit: Kill List (out 2 Sept). Brilliant, scabrous contract-killer's eye on modern Britain spends its load in daft Wicker Man-esque denouement
quikcrit: The Interrupters (out 12 August). Only one place (problematically) for this weighty doc about Chicago gang violence to go: towards hope
quikcrit: @MarkSherbert #warpfilmsremake Noel Clarke doing a 'grime'n'dubstep' On the Buses
quikcrit: ... I doubled Retromania up with Nietzsche's 'The Uses and Abuses of History for Life'. The same Qs, 140 years ago
quikcrit: ... from the last half-century. The million-dollar question - are we finished? - should have been the starting point, not the end...
quikcrit: ... retro in pop is itself retro, but gives in to the current malaise, and gets listlessly diverted in cataloguing every single instance...
quikcrit: ... Bairro Alta quarter. This is the precursor to an important book, but it doesn't go anywhere near far enough. SR demonstrates that...
quikcrit: A few thoughts on Simon Reynolds's Retromania, mostly consumed in a appropriate environs of a surf bar in Lisbon's current hipsterfying...
quikcrit: Last Year at Marienbad (1961). Liberated from prose, Robbe-Grillet runs riot in Orphic purgatory: the Overlook hotel, in high season
quikcrit: The Tree of Life (2011). Malick, He moveth in montage-based ways. Flashes of illumination in this tone-poem, but it gets a bit bogged down
quikcrit: ... but not before he gave it a cheesy 80s-style thriller title. What the hell has happened to David Mackenzie (Young Adam)?
quikcrit: Perfect Sense (out 7 Oct). V.bad apocalypse-of-the-senses with Eva Green and Ewan McGregor. Writer got bored before he got to "touch" ...
quikcrit: Tomboy (out 16 Sept). Sweet, unfussy character study of a 10-year-girl by Waterlilies's Cline Sciamma: the mirror image of Ma Vie En Rose
quikcrit: A Separation (out 1 July). Gripping Tehran whodunnit that pins together the personal and the political with each sharply cut plot twist
quikcrit: ... subjected to this kind of treatment, I feel, just to remind them where they're from. Ewan McGregor next.
quikcrit: ... then hurled against a castle wall in his own trebuchet. British thesps who do too many Hollywood films should be periodically ...
quikcrit: Me, chatting shit about weirdly enlightened Belgian soft-drinks publicity, for the advertising blog Hawkblocker http://t.co/x60gs6y
quikcrit: Me, yaddering on about "freakout films", the new wave of thirtysomething comedy, for the Guardian http://t.co/Lt8GcR5
quikcrit: Me, blabbing on about Sacha Baron Cohen and Charlie Chaplin for the Guardian http://t.co/uUmrNQY
quikcrit: The Hangover (2009/2nd time). To summarise: the sound of Zach Galifianakis's mirthless laugh at the newest fucked-up episode
quikcrit: The Great Dictator (1940). Love it when the classics are as good as rumoured. I will only shave to Brahms from now on
quikcrit: Omen III: The Final Conflict (1981). Weird, haughty Sam Neill performance. Tried a bit too hard with the Satanic fatalities
quikcrit: The Dilemma (2011). Contorted requiem for the American Dream flashes through Vince Vaughn's eyes as they sink into his ballooning cheeks
quikcrit: House of Games (1987). Mamet beds the con flick in lost desires, parapraxes, psychological silt. Lets slip a little misogyny of his own, too
quikcrit: Future segment in Adam Curtis doc RT @guardiannews Syrian lesbian blogger is revealed conclusively to be a married man http://t.co/WVIA4Bt
quikcrit: The Disappearance of Alice Creed (2009). Sleek-faced Martin Compston, the real leading lady here, dances on J Blakeson's sixpence twists
quikcrit: The Sting (1973). AKA the loneliness of the long-distance conman. Efficient, brittle, but not the Newman-Redford love-in I'd expected
quikcrit: Bridesmaids (out 24 June). Formulaic, but got the basics down, from broad coemdy (extended diarrhoea skits) to well-embroidered characters
quikcrit: Me, getting all up in a tizz for Comment Is Free about The Flaw and the post-credit crunch wave of documentaries http://bit.ly/jYPx0r
quikcrit: Inside Job (2011). Rock-solid case for the prosecution vs nervous giggles, stuttered denials, stonewallings. They call this a stalemate
quikcrit: Attack the Block (2011). Pristinely pop-culture calibrated, anaemically written; Kidulthood sharper on LDN slang. First big 2011 letdown
quikcrit: Another Year (2010/2nd time). Sympathised much more with Tom + Geri (hated them on first pass). Provencale audience tickled
quikcrit: @james_hamlin P'raps a bit harsh: great battle scenes. Thought Snafu was the only decent performance. Very dull otherwise...
quikcrit: The Pacific. Stepping out of my usual remit, but was forced to watch at Xmas, and have to mention how rubbish it is: zero characterisation
quikcrit: Dragon Tiger Gate (2006). Mistook this for Dragon Gate Inn. Remember almost nothing apart from feather cuts and the "Electric Dragon Drill"
quikcrit: The Ring (2002). Workmanlike upgrade of Ringu: lugubrious pace and satanic touches. Naomi Watts v.good, though: unexpectedly spiky and sexy
quikcrit: Face/Off (1997/2nd time). The kind of star-centric, high-pomp mayhem endangered by CGI. Travolta-doing-Cage actually channels Jim Carrey
quikcrit: Couples Retreat (2009). Viewing this for professional purposes. Actually rather satisfying it turned out as toxically bad as it began
quikcrit: The Flaw (out 3 June). Another (concise, slick) breakdown of 2008 credit hubris. But we need to watch The Alternative
quikcrit: Let the Right One In (2008). The vampire mythos put at the service (brilliantly so) of something emotionally honest: the roots of violence
quikcrit: Heartbreaker (2010). Romain Duris's "tears" have the potential to be the new Blue Steel, before bad last-act cave-in to romcom convention
quikcrit: Due Date (2010). Well-written, with a sour edge, but too bitter to hook audience. Downey Jr possibly miscast?
quikcrit: Russian Ark (2002). Unblinking crawl through the Hermitage/the bowels of Russian modernity. Like swallowing a copy of War and Peace whole
quikcrit: Gozu (2003). Bull-headed demon, lactation fetish, woman birthing fully grown man. Miike's shockers too sparsely situated this time though
quikcrit: Black Book (2006). Verhoeven tries to comment on the Holocaust *and* have a scene in which someone mistakes a hidden gun for an erection
quikcrit: @JuleeWhalin Hey Julee, I know! Saw her a few weeks ago, and she was big (but looking good). How are you?
quikcrit: Interesting David Cox point about double-standards re the recent vogue for pre-pubescent female assassins http://bit.ly/lLC7Dm
quikcrit: Is it wrong to admit to having a begrudging kind of respect for Danny Dyer? I admire a well-ploughed furrow http://ind.pn/lSZ5Hd
quikcrit: The great Takashi Miike - with me channelling his words medium-style - on classic samurai movies in the Guardian http://bit.ly/lbE1t7
quikcrit: Here's me, sticking it to Barclays, and The Man in general, on my buddy Chris's blog about advertising, Hawkblocker: http://bit.ly/m9WfSz
quikcrit: Ichi the Killer (2001). Takashi Miike's baleful dance around the poles of sadism and masochism hits a delirious haemoglobin high
quikcrit: Hate to state the obvious, but Brian Eno really is one sharp dude. Via Pitchfork: http://t.co/ZbVCloV
quikcrit: The strange U-turn of "the next Terence Malick", David Gordon Green http://t.co/moqmxai
quikcrit: The Beat That My Heart Skipped (2005). Pains me to say it, but not as substantial as on firecracker first viewing. Duris holds this together
quikcrit: 127 Hours (out 7 Jan). Trainspotting's cold-turkey scene, outdoors. Engagingly hyperactive/tactile. Convinced D.Boyle has an endings problem
quikcrit: Dear Doctor (LFF). Fake doctor in rural Japan throws up sly Qs about authority vacuum in ageing society. By Koreeda protege Miwa Nishikawa
quikcrit: A propos the last link: Pakistan gets a taste of the time-honoured 'He seemed like a normal guy' journalistic neighbourhood postmortem
quikcrit: 'Can we have our ball back please, Mr Bin Laden?' Sometimes you just have to hand it to The Sun http://bit.ly/iIjFyK
quikcrit: Deft retread in GQ of a much-recounted story: the legend of Herzog. (He doesn't believe Woody Allen has milked a cow) http://bit.ly/mpGEer
quikcrit: Beautiful eulogy to the late Restrepo director Tim Hetherington, by Xan Brooks http://bit.ly/fyZ0W8
quikcrit: Duck Season (2004). Y Tu Mama Tambien: The Early Years. Perhaps a bit more beholden to the spirit of US indies
quikcrit: And what was that disclaimer about? "Remember: not every citizen of Charlestown is a gangster." The 'Fleck protesteth too much, methinks
quikcrit: The Town (2010). Corrupted screenplay makes subtle genuflections towards Affleck: urban saint. His directing is improving, his acting not
quikcrit: @alexneedham74 It was particularly half-hearted (in the midst of an otherwise pretty good film)
quikcrit: @CarolineNo On and off. Something occurred to me on the bus this morning. The featured crocodile farm is near my parents'. Vested interest
quikcrit: Memento Mori (1999). Carrie-style lesbian psychodrama with touches of imperial Lynchian surrealism. Very unconvincing girl-snog, tho
quikcrit: I think I understand Herzog's crocodiles prologue now (without the aid of any narcotics)
quikcrit: No idea what Herzog was smoking when he wrote the crocodiles postscript to Cave, though. Very strange
quikcrit: @kenjfuj A little bit. Was less wilfully opaque, and JG is a personable presence. Still found the central relationship pretty formulaic
quikcrit: Cave of Forgotten Dreams (2011). Homo tri-dimensionalis finally steps fully into the realm of representation imagined by his ancestors
quikcrit: Source Code (2011). Wasn't crazy about Inception, but this felt like a fan-fiction version of that: high on its own invention, but thin
quikcrit: Miike back on. Though it's via email, and I have to stick purely to samurai-related Qs (our stipulation, not his)
quikcrit: Gutted at Miike interview being blown out yesterday. Had to been looking forward to asking the slacker: why only 80 films in 20 years?
quikcrit: 13 Assassins (out 6 May). Miike Takashi's Seven Samurai reprise blows cool strategist's first half with numbing village-siege frenzy
quikcrit: In Bruges (2008/2nd time). Solemn (meaningful?) without a pissed-up audience. Don't Look Now's jocular northern-European twin
quikcrit: The Odyssey (1997). Imaginative, for a TV film. Threw a most un-Homeric wobbly when I was interrupted during Odysseus's big curtain-raiser

tpaleyfilm: @worldcupsusie As super excited as me. Haven't seen them win for so long now mind you. Not all last season - or this so far . . .
tpaleyfilm: @Matt_Cinephile S' wonderful; S' marvellous.
tpaleyfilm: @GeorgieMHobbs Martin one of the most seriously creepy films I have ever seen. Not been able to watch it again.

tpaleyfilm: @FluffyRona Best was Wanda followed by The Artist. Didn't see any to make the worst category.
tpaleyfilm: @deedeesvintage Hey, thanks for RTs. You may have seen The Innocents but Night of the Eagle well worth catching tomorrow if not seen before.

tpaleyfilm: @suzanne_moore Column inches?
tpaleyfilm: Cinema of contrasts: wet weekday half-term treat TINTIN 3D for sons now; tonight's treat: bleak, British 70s road movie RADIO ON.
tpaleyfilm: @FluffyRona Your best and worst of #LFF please.
tpaleyfilm: MT @charlesgant Last day of Sandra Hebron's last London Film Fest. Respect to a legend of good taste, energy and persuasive diplomacy. #LFF
tpaleyfilm: #bestfilminlondontoday: The much-lauded Footnote @VueCinemas Leicester Square at London Film Festival #LFF http://t.co/04mAtl80
tpaleyfilm: So farewell then artistic director Sandra Hebron, boots and all. Transformed #LFF and will be sorely missed.
tpaleyfilm: @JigsawLounge When I saw VERTIGO at first revival in 80s folks laughed at ending when nun causes Novak to fall!
tpaleyfilm: @victoriarusso Verdict later please.
tpaleyfilm: @neerdowellfilms Hello. I did have that movie 5-2 favourite so some of us were also in the know. Let&#39;s share the love in 2012.
tpaleyfilm: @neerdowellfilms
tpaleyfilm: @StuartMaconie Finally, Hunstanton welcomes careful drivers. http://t.co/rxa8JUTV
tpaleyfilm: @StuartMaconie Hunstanton Bingo! Six wins - no flies on you!  http://t.co/9at32pXt
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi No problem. Just wondered who best to talk to there. Will send in form - did you go last year?
tpaleyfilm: @victoriarusso Interested to hear thoughts. Some lukewarm reviews. Saw Videodrome on Saturday. Has Cronenberg become bland? #LFF
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi I will apply for accreditation. Do you have any contacts there?
tpaleyfilm: @StuartMaconie Turn the corner and . . .  http://t.co/9ushMeVp
tpaleyfilm: @StuartMaconie In contrast: Solo in Hunstanton. What goes on behind this door?  http://t.co/h0xBDjc5
tpaleyfilm: @StuartMaconie Please send pics.
tpaleyfilm: @StuartMaconie One of the favourite days of my life spent doing precisely that - on my own in Florence; not pretending to be MM!
tpaleyfilm: #bestfilminlondontoday: Sean Penn in This Must Be The Place @VueCinemas Leicester Square at London Film Festival #LFF http://t.co/iNzhAUbL
tpaleyfilm: @A_lafemmebrune Is it Joan Bennett?
tpaleyfilm: @Phil_on_Film @giruaro Reading Twenty Thousand Streets Under The Sky right now
tpaleyfilm: @anotherkate Only found JR who is positive. Some have walked out. Await your verdict.
tpaleyfilm: @victoriarusso Have you read Tom Huddleston's review from Time Out on Capital Celluloid blog? Sounds v good. Did you see at press screening?
tpaleyfilm: #bestfilminlondontoday: Riveting doc Better This World @VueCinemas Leicester Square at London Film Festival #LFF. http://t.co/NMd1hJPj
tpaleyfilm: @GuyLodge Congratulations Guy. Thoroughly deserved. All the best there.
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf Never seen The Tarnished Angels advertised as showing at any cinema and waited a couple of decades.
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf Would be wonderful to see them on big screen. Sirk's shot composition and use of colour v impressive.
tpaleyfilm: @JigsawLounge LANCELOT DU LAC among my very favourites. ARGENT v impressive.
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf Superb. All That Heaven Allows; Imitation of Life and The Tarnished Angels not to be missed too.
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf . . . and the rain is pouring. "If you try to grasp happiness your fingers only meet glass. It's hopeless."
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf There's Always Tomorrow is Sirk's most underrated film. Once Upon A Time in sunny California . . .
tpaleyfilm: @nicolapiggott Damsels in Distress
tpaleyfilm: @neerdowellfilms Here, what do ya mean? Had the winner 5-2 fav  . . .
tpaleyfilm: @dalston_david Think I would have cleaned up there too. Plenty of predictions for films that had no chance (eg unfinished Iron Lady)
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi No problem. Just wondered who best to talk to there. Will send in form - did you go last year?
tpaleyfilm: @victoriarusso Interested to hear thoughts. Some lukewarm reviews. Saw Videodrome on Saturday. Has Cronenberg become bland? #LFF
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi I will apply for accreditation. Do you have any contacts there?
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi Neither am I unfortunately. Scala Forever likely to come back next year in some form.
tpaleyfilm: @JigsawLounge LANCELOT DU LAC? ARGENT?
tpaleyfilm: @carmen_gray A must-see then.
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi You going to see anything else at #LFF?
tpaleyfilm: @carmen_gray Hey, I saw that film featured in @TheStoryofFilm on Saturday night. Going to The Film Shop at first opportunity. Thanks.
tpaleyfilm: #bestfilminlondontoday: Nicholas Ray's great docudrama WE CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN @BFI Southbank London Film Festival http://t.co/IpHkfR6b #LFF
tpaleyfilm: @carmen_gray Which film is used as the background on your Twitter page? Do they get down?
tpaleyfilm: Today I discovered you can buy a jug that sorts out the sediment from roasts to make gravy and also what 'cathar sex' is #adaynotwastedthen
tpaleyfilm: RT @wendyide: New blog post: my thoughts on the #surprisefilm http://t.co/iUqZRO5y #LFF
tpaleyfilm: @FluffyRona Heard good reports for both of those. Enjoy.
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi Enjoy (hopefully). Pleasant dreams.
tpaleyfilm: @bglendenning I enjoyed it a lot.
tpaleyfilm: @FluffyRona Going to anything else at #LFF?
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi V much enjoyed writing this: http://t.co/kqCQxnEx
tpaleyfilm: @deedeesvintage Hope you have a lovely time. Soundtrack?
tpaleyfilm: Eyes Wide Shut Halloween Party anyone? http://t.co/sv6zvHbM Do you have the password? http://t.co/sv6zvHbM via @matevzluzar
tpaleyfilm: #bestfilminlondontoday: The chilling movie MICHAEL @CurzonCinemas Mayfair at London Film Festival http://t.co/6Qjbka8G #LFF
tpaleyfilm: @deedeesvintage Love that tune. Brings back very many happy memories. None connected with football.
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi That's v kind of you. I blog daily: http://t.co/VK5kmoUv And scribble occasionally for Graunaid: http://t.co/XKZJagGE
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf Sandra loves Stillman so it was always on the radar but no surprise it has divided the audience.
tpaleyfilm: @Filmaluation I would have and will love Damsels In Distress I'm sure but Stillman's newie a gamble as #LFF #surprise film. Divided audience
tpaleyfilm: @FluffyRona I shall be going to see it at first opportunity but aware Stillman a film-maker who is not to everyone's taste.
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi If you like tonight's offering then sure you will like his previous work. Check them out.
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf The film won me over. Think Stillman great but aware others not as keen. Was a gamble by Sandra.
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi No. I'm serious. Loved The Last Days of Disco so was looking forward to Stillman's first film since then.
tpaleyfilm: @bglendenning It's not the Dyson. It's @MarkGatiss.
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi sorry here's link that works http://t.co/WdcASb57
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf Seen The Last Days of Disco http://t.co/WdcASb57 or Metropolitan? Loved them but Whitman not to everyone's taste.
tpaleyfilm: @soosie_soo And stole your choccie.
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi Sara. I couldn't get there. All I need to know: as good as The Last Days of Disco? youtu.be/L10AJrKTqcA
tpaleyfilm: @AlexHayesArt I loved this: http://t.co/IXayj0ox
tpaleyfilm: @sara_salehi Wish I had heard that. Big fan of Jarvis and that programme my radio highlight these days.
tpaleyfilm: @AlexHayesArt Actually I am really looking forward to this movie. Big fan of Mr Stillman so hopes are high but won't be to everyone's taste.
tpaleyfilm: For #LFF followers there's been more Twittertastic entertainment from @FluffyRona tonight who has walked out of #SurpriseFilm.
tpaleyfilm: @AlexHayesArt Surprise, surprise. It is.
tpaleyfilm: @victoriarusso Ross Lipman introduced Wanda. He found and restored the movie. Details at end of article: http://t.co/XKZJagGE
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf A Face is a film I wasn't aware of. Love those recommendations.
tpaleyfilm: @nicolapiggott Damsels in Distress
tpaleyfilm: @neerdowellfilms Here, what do ya mean? Had the winner 5-2 fav  . . .
tpaleyfilm: @dalston_david Think I would have cleaned up there too. Plenty of predictions for films that had no chance (eg unfinished Iron Lady)
tpaleyfilm: Favourite has come in RT @iFlicks: It's time to play the music.. It's time to light the lights.. for Damsels in Distress #LFF #surprisefilm
tpaleyfilm: 6-4  . . .  I'm offering 6-4 from 5-2 RT @ultraculture: Sounds like its going to be Damsels in Distress. #surprisefilm #LFF
tpaleyfilm: @danieljparsons The ending  . . . too much to bear.
tpaleyfilm: Footnote I have heard excellent reports about and is my blog pick for later in the week. Michael was very good.
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf My pleasure. Unfortunately no more #LFF for me. You?
tpaleyfilm: @FluffyRona The Artist was great fun though have some reservations as it hitches a ride on other great movies and no depth but was a delight
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf The opening scene alone gives me the willies (no pun intended). Classic Hitchcock - mayhem amid ordinary life.
tpaleyfilm: @Jet_Jaguar Been told not ready.
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf V boring indeed. What do you make of Rope? Would like to see again. V uncomfortable viewing.
tpaleyfilm: @victoriarusso The film or the red carpet preamble?
tpaleyfilm: 5-2 favourite  . . . RT @FluffyRona: Please God, having read the synopsis on imdb don't let the #SurpriseFilm be #DamselsinDistress!  #lFF
tpaleyfilm: Just got to find this ne'er do well clearly RT @neerdowellfilms: I know #lff #surprisefilm and am loving that no one will guess it.
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf Always found Robert Walker an interesting presence. Or do you mean Farley Granger character (zzzzzzz)
tpaleyfilm: @FluffyRona Enjoyed your Festival? Paid good money for The Artist and The Kid With A Bike and enjoyed both #lff
tpaleyfilm: @neerdowellfilms Either you are bluffing and will live up to your Twitter monicker or we are all in for a huge surprise #surprisefilm #lff
tpaleyfilm: @ultraculture Moneyball 7-2 second-favourite in my book. #surprisefilm #lff
tpaleyfilm: So @catherinebray @BBCFilm2011 top 5 openings: 5 2001 4 Who Framed Roger Rabbit? 3 A Hard Day's Night 2 Ghost Ship 1 Touch of Evil Discuss
tpaleyfilm: @victoriarusso @mascolo Let me know how many laughs there are in it. W.E. #LFF
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf So many great scenes in that film too. The island and the Love Boat; the extended tennis match; Washington monumnet (?) . .
tpaleyfilm: #LFF #SurpriseFilm betting cont: 14 The Iron Lady, The Woman In Black, 20 The Turin Horse 33 The Muppets.  (now with Hugo added).
tpaleyfilm: #LFF #SurpriseFilm: 5-2 Damsels In Distress 7-2 Moneyball 5 The Rum Diary 6 Le Havre 7 My Week With Marilyn, 10 War Horse, Hugo . . .
tpaleyfilm: @GuyLodge Gosh you're right. That has not been mentioned in recent days but had been widely touted. Hugo 10-1 #LFF #SurpriseFilm
tpaleyfilm: Ipcress File; Crossroads etc  . . . RT @guardianfilm: Sue Lloyd obituary http://t.co/CLH45qwB
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf One of 1st times ever heard anyone extol virtues of film was primary school head and that scene. Couldn't wait to see it.
tpaleyfilm: Apologies. Missed Le Havre out of betting. Have re-formed market . . . #LFF #SurpriseFilm
tpaleyfilm: #LFF #SurpriseFilm: 5-2 Damsels In Distress 7-2 Moneyball 5 The Rum Diary 6 Le Havre 7 My Week With Marilyn, 10 War Horse 12 The Iron Lady..
tpaleyfilm: @matevzluzar No, I was at another movie. What did you think?
tpaleyfilm: @danieljparsons Wasn't that part of the reason it was so interesting as  a film . . .
tpaleyfilm: 14 The Woman In Black, 20 The Turin Horse 33 The Muppets. Lot of late money for Whit Stillman movie. Wide open this year #LFF #SurpriseFilm
tpaleyfilm: @wendyide  . . . sell out and forgot to book press tickets until yesterday and missed the 48-hour deadline so I'm stayin in (sob).
tpaleyfilm: @wendyide Actually I tell a lie. Cock-up. Was going to go Experimenta with The Pettifogger tonight but didn't realise would . . .
tpaleyfilm: @wendyide Wish I was but no. Half-term has kicked in.
tpaleyfilm: @wendyide Have you seen Damsels? Being backed as of it's past the post!
tpaleyfilm: @wendyide Plumping for Damsels In Distress or Le Havre for #SurpriseFilm at #LFF. Any last thoughts yourself? Are you going?
tpaleyfilm: My final thoughts are Damsels In Distress or Le Havre #LFF #Surprise Film
tpaleyfilm: @GuyLodge @victoriarusso Go for the 140 Guy. After the premiere of course. No s(p)oilers. Sorry little joke with V.
tpaleyfilm: @victoriarusso I want a 140-character assassination . . . or a love letter to the movie if you feel so inclined.
tpaleyfilm: @deedeesvintage Hope you have a lovely time. Soundtrack?

tpaleyfilm: @MaxRenn Great. I never knew where you obtained your Twitter monicker until ten minutes into the film.
tpaleyfilm: @matevzluzar I wish I could but it's half-term so I can't make it. You must report back if you go.
tpaleyfilm: @MaxRenn Long live the new flesh http://t.co/I3LbVRx9

tpaleyfilm: @PPlasticHelmet #TheStoryofFilm v inspiring.
tpaleyfilm: @GuyLodge If you come to see Videodrome @riocinema that will still stand as it doesn't start till midnight.

tpaleyfilm: @trim_obey @weekendmovie Saw Mr Grant (and Midlake) perform that album at RFH last month. Exceptional. 'Where Dreams Go To Die' a highlight
tpaleyfilm: @BlackHoleMovies Are you venturing out for Videodrome?
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf Oh, and by mentioning The B** Le***ski you will already have been spam botted by The Dude, or El Duderino, or . . .
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf @ThePCCLondon Forget it L. Q. Larsen. You're out of your element.
tpaleyfilm: @WaughWildeWoolf Thanks. Are you venturing out today to see anything?
tpaleyfilm: If Theo and I (the only patrons) weren't in Screen 7 here would Lion King 3D still play and, if it did, would it make a sound?
tpaleyfilm: Only pair in cinema at @VueCinemas Islington for Lion King 3D but would love to be queuing for this  http://t.co/Km7cIkyH
tpaleyfilm: @deedeesvintage You are so right. Looking forward to this one a lot. See you later x
