TW:::AnneBillson:::@barryegan1575 Afghanistan Bananastand.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@barryegan1575 Aloha!
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::Luc Besson's ARTHUR & THE GREAT ADVENTURE has the strangest voice cast: Selena Gomez, Lou Reed & Iggy Pop. (Bowie was in the last one.)
TW:::AnneBillson:::@barryegan1575 Ja.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@barryegan1575 Si.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@barryegan1575 Am.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@anfo_ Takkie Kakkie!!! Who on earth thinks these things up?
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@anfo_ I have fond memories of Amsterdamned!
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::The Scary Door (from Futurama): http://t.co/KF5W8VQZ
TW:::AnneBillson:::@FrankieMcGinty A Mexican Wrestler who goes by the name of EL ZOIDBERG!
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@barryegan1575 Does too!
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@DarkEyeSocket @johnwarrender Hurrah for Mr Fox! He should have been the star of Fantastic Mr Fox!
TW:::AnneBillson:::@johnwarrender Haven't seen Take Shelter, and no idea when I can see it. No release date for Belgium, though out in France in Jan.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@barryegan1575 Does so.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@johnwarrender @mixmasterfestus It has funny bits too. Udo Kier is funny!
TW:::AnneBillson:::@ryuganji For ages I just thought he had a bad complexion. So felt a bit guilty when I found out. Audiences adored him for his good looks.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@nrm1972 @DukeofYorks I haven't seen that one. And can't say I'm dashing out to rent it. Maybe one day. Like when I don't have a choice.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@johnwarrender Glad to hear you liked Melancholia. Affected me the way some people said Tree of Life affected them. Competely awestruck.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@punkyscudmonkey Dammit, now Zoidberg's voice has taken up residency in my head.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@nrm1972 That made me laugh. Which Bela Tarr film took your hymen? (I've never dared to attempt the 450-minute Satantango)
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@nrm1972 That made me laugh. Which Bela Tarr film took your hymen? (I've never dared to attempt the 450-minute Satantango)
TW:::AnneBillson:::@DarkEyeSocket ooooh now I'll be SO disappointed if she has two eyes. I want to see the Futurama Batman, dammit.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@ryuganji You know Kazuo Hasegawa (An Actor's Revenge) had his face slashed with a razor in 1937 because he quit one studio for another?
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::BANE: http://t.co/Ysok3wqs ZOIDBERG: http://t.co/Ix9RgIpu I rest my case.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@Normatrix You're welcome. I have no doubt this realisation will make my own experience of the new Batman film a lot more enjoyable.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@mr_ceebs I would really like to see a ruff designed to look like a silver platter, with pretend dried blood all around the neck.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@dandouglas @mixmasterfestus I thought maybe it was a contraction of lolcatz. Or is that lolkatz?
TW:::AnneBillson:::@BrionyKidd It's kind of like the verbal equivalent of a shrug. Much to my surprise it's in my dictionary. "So what?" [exprime la lassitude]
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@mixmasterfestus The world's most laugh-out-loud car.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@thirstygargoyle Oh dear. Ruined it for everyone now, have I? Oops sorry.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@angusbatey cthulhu!
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@dandouglas @mixmasterfestus What does lulz stand for? Laughed Up Loud, um, Zero?
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@mr_ceebs Now you've got me thinking about ruffs. I wonder why they've never come back into fashion.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@mixmasterfestus Sometimes think I'm being clever by using French equivalent mdr (mort de rire). But of course only French tweeters get it.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::Oh dear. Afraid Tom Hardy's BANE mask makes me think of Zoidberg from Futurama. Which I'm fairly sure was not the film-makers' intention.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@angusbatey I smtms do tht whn I'm dsprte. But looks as though you're a lot more skilled at it then I am.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@punkyscudmonkey Odds fish!
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@dukemedia_uk I haven't got round to using emoticons. Mostly because it would take me half an afternoon to work one out.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@BrionyKidd Pah is quite useful. I also like "pff" and "bof" which I imagine make me sound French.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@MaxRenn I've not yet developed the asterisk habit. Where I would normally use italics I go INTO CAPS INSTEAD. Which looks like shouting.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@mixmasterfestus Yes, I think that's true. I probably use it because I'm too embarrassed to use "lol". (Even in quotes it makes me cringe.)
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::Twitter habits I've developed: 1) exclamation marks a-go-go! 2) repeated use of exclamation "ha!" as if I'm some sort of Elizabethan dandy.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@CinemartNow I like Pig in the City! But quite understand why parents and children were shocked. It traumatised me!
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@DanielNothing OK I'll maybe skip to five. Yeah, Darryl is only character I like. I'd quite enjoy watching all the others getting eaten.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@mixmasterfestus @iamamro Spiked pads sounds like a perilous game of cricket! Ooh I love tickling cats' paws. Haven't done that for YEARS.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@DanielNothing After which I never bothered to tune into episode 2 of the new season. Just... zzzzzzzzz. Can I skip ahead to a good ep?
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@DanielNothing Which Walking Dead episode is that? How many can I skip? I left them talking to God & girl was lost & boy had just got shot.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@iamamro If he lived in my house I would spend all my time gazing worshipfully at him. Which would not be good for his character.
TW:::AnneBillson:::I see Pink has taken over from the late Brittany Murphy as the voice of Gloria in HAPPY FEET 2. Is it so awful? First one got quite dark.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@iamamro Pushkin! I DO like it. Thank you. He is so handsome and adorable (not to mention helpful around the house) and knows it.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@2timesF Looking forward to my first Christmas in Belgium! (Though if it's anything like Friday's student rag fest I shall stay indoors)
TW:::AnneBillson:::@anfo_ Thank you for the faux Sesame Street clip. My aim is to watch that every day till my eyes and ears bleed.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@anfo_ @annelouverboon I can't wait to see THIS (though preferably not with this awful dubbing): http://t.co/QkS4E6eU
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@patrickabbott Americans.
TW:::AnneBillson:::Ye ancient politically-incorrect Belgian tradition of... Zwart Piet: http://t.co/LE3yZ1VF
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@johnwarrender Goed nacht & good luck w/ neighbours. Why can't we just all arrange to live in the same house? Life would be so much easier.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@fredhogge Maybe a fast-acting beer then?
TW:::AnneBillson:::@Phelimo @julianstockton @paulmcevoy I HATED the Friends monkey. I was SO HAPPY when they got rid of it.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::Just realised the ultimate vehicle-crashing-into-immoveable object scenario was footage of 9/11. Sorry about that. Only just occurred to me.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@BlackHoleMovies @streetrw That would make sense. They were certainly very proud of that scene.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@pdfinegan And I'm just drunk enough to reciprocate by saying oh thank you that's really sweet.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@johnwarrender @Phelimo Yes. Harry Potter worked perfectly translated into French b/c story-driven. King less story-driven than he appears.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@fredhogge It's basically the sort of info that convinces me I need to carry fast-acting cyanide pills with me at all times.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@julianstockton @paulmcevoy @Phelimo Did they make Outbreak veer off in that silly direction on purpose, lest it become too upsetting?
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@julianstockton @paulmcevoy @Phelimo You're almost making me want to watch that again. Just for that monkey photo scene. UNBELIEVABLE!!!
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@johnwarrender @Phelimo He did not translate well at all. Got the impression he was far more of a stylist than people give him credit for.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@johnwarrender @Phelimo Stephen King was the author that surprised me most when I was reading English writers in French translation.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@BinaryDad Don't worry, I never said it to anyone (or at least I don't think so).
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@mapsadaisical When I read your tweet I actually made an excited squealy sound. Because I am going to try Rochefort 10 next time!
TW:::AnneBillson:::Think I must be really drunk. After 2 Rocheforts. I have this terrible urge to tweet people to tell them how much I love their avatar pics.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@johnwarrender @Phelimo But the novel was quite rubbish to begin with. That shit-weasel business did make me worry about where King was at.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@FilmLandEmpire @PPlasticHelmet @24fpsuk Crash was totally naff; I can't BEGIN to understand how it won Oscars. Oh I guess I can, but still.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@Phelimo I think it's Stephen King who should apologise, not you. But currently reading his latest, and it's excellent; his best in years.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::I noted from the menu at La Belladonne that there is something called a ROCHEFORT 10. I shall have to do some research into this next time.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::Tonight's Adventure in Belgian Beer: ROCHEFORT 8 http://t.co/3mKMxjEK I REALLY liked this one; in fact, I had TWO! Now a teensy bit wiffled.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@paulmcevoy @Phelimo @julianstockton "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MONKEY?" One of the funniest lines EVER. Film totally went down the plughole then.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::Other good things in BODY HEAT: Mickey Rourke as "rock n roll arsonist" (thanks @splendorcinema) Ted Danson as dancing lawyer. Great stuff.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@splendorcinema And he embodied that SO brilliantly!
TW:::AnneBillson:::@Ruby_Stevens The Man With Two Brains could well be my favourite comedy of all time. "I couldn't fuck a gorilla."
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@24FPSUK @FilmLandEmpire STOP IT ALL OF YOU! I WANT TO SEE IT! WHY CAN'T I SEE IT? (more foot-stomping and teenagey tantrums)
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@derekhill82 Haven't finished it yet, but I'm hooked and (though have been avoiding spoilers) get impression he doesn't drop the ball.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@splendorcinema I can't even bring myself to watch the clip. Waste of a really strong cast, as well.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@FilmLandEmpire That's enough spoilers! (Luckily I shall probably forget them.)
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@janehill64 @lpmorgado Rourke is wonderful, oozing charisma in a tiny role. Still oozes charisma, but without the beautiful face alas.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@derekhill82 Yes, not one of Big Steve's finest. Just telling @SteveSparshott, his latest one (11/22/1963) is his best novel in years.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::"You're not too smart, are you? I like that in a man." Has there ever been a hotter acting debut ? Or a more fearless performance as a sap?
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::When I first saw BODY HEAT in 1981, I dismissed it as a pastiche film noir. But the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it. Great screenplay!
TW:::AnneBillson:::@derekhill82 It was bad. But I have seen worse.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@owenweetch Must have had his name removed, then, because it's not on imdb. (Not that I blame him if that that was the case.)
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@SteveSparshott It's not one of Damian's best. Nor one of King's best, come to that. King's new one 11/22/63 (or whatever) is terrific BTW.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@BobCoupee I would have thought UK arthouse chains, at least, would have snapped it up eagerly. Maybe they have, but can't find any info.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@streetrw @Ruby_Stevens Must try & get hold of it - always bugged me I had pan-and-scan version. Couldn't see the bouncing bricks properly.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@AndrewMaleMojo No, I think it really does exist...
TW:::AnneBillson:::@FilmLandEmpire I have no doubt. I WANT TO SEE IT! (stamps foot in teenagey tantrum)
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@CyberWasteland Yessir. (Noise of gunfire)
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::Lawrence Kasdan's last film was Dreamcatcher, 2003. He has a new film coming out in 2012, but I wonder what he's been up to in the meantime.
TW:::AnneBillson:::What's happened to Whit Stillman's DAMSELS IN DISTRESS? Where is it? Why can't I see it? Why isn't it on any lists of forthcoming releases?
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@johnwarrender @Ruby_Stevens I remember the bouncing cathedral bricks. And Michael Hordern has a terrific cameo as a medium.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@Ruby_Stevens I have a Medusa Touch DVD. But you're probably right, it IS very old, so old it's pan-and-scan. Probably from the 90s.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@streetrw Yes, I did notice and enjoy the score - one of those breezy we're-on-a-train numbers I don't think we get any more.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::Just realised the ultimate vehicle-crashing-into-immoveable object scenario was footage of 9/11. Sorry about that. Only just occurred to me.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@BlackHoleMovies @streetrw That would make sense. They were certainly very proud of that scene.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@AnnoDracula There must be an earlier example. Maybe in the silents. Does The General end up crashing into something? Can't remember.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@katelaity It's fun. Perfect TV viewing.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@ronportnoir Silver Streak.
TW:::AnneBillson:::Is SILVER STREAK the blueprint for big vehicles crashing into immoveable objects? (cf the ship in Speed 2) Anyone think of earlier examples?
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::IIRC, they actually showed the big climax of Silver Streak in the 1976 trailer.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::"In 10 minutes you're going to have 200 tons of locomotive smashing through Central Station on its way to Marshall Fields!"
TW:::AnneBillson:::@gfdedwards I love his style. Harold & Maude too! (Though I've never seen The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.) Shame he died so young.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@Ryan_Man2 I love comedy thrillers from that era! This, and Foul Play (also Colin Higgins, who wrote Streak screenplay) and Hopscotch.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@Ryan_Man2 And Pryor arrives just when energy flags. I'm at the bit where Wilder blacks up! Are they Hollywood's first mixed-race buddies?
TW:::AnneBillson:::@anfo_ Must check the Frank Boeyen Groep out. Even if I can't make out the words...
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@Dealfatigue Oh dear, what have I done now?
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::Rewatching SILVER STREAK. Love it that 1976's idea of amorous couple in a romantic thriller is GENE WILDER & JILL CLAYBURGH. (Works for me.)
TW:::AnneBillson:::@fredhogge Thanks for that. Though not sure whether I'd want to put it to the test.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::Russ Meyer's ex-wife Eve Meyer, star of Eve and the Handyman & producer of many of his films, died in the 1977 airport disaster in Tenerife.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@orangewarrior No. That would be awful.
TW:::AnneBillson:::Someone just buzzed me from the street. "Est-ce que c'est vous qui avez appellé la police?" Told him no. But I think I can guess who it was.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@enigmachine @KermodeMovie I don't think that's true. I get the impression that the Twilight films get sneered at a lot more than others.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@Tim_Sadleir Just saw Snowtown! Some good pics coming out of Australia now. Guardian film section is online if you ever fancy looking it up.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@Gally_Freya Yay! Go for it!
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@JohnForth I'm halfway through the King - thinking it's his best in years.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@CharlieEdmunds I wouldn't dare in case one or both of them charged upstairs & beat me up. They're both quite aggressive-sounding.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@glitternova @johnwarrender My problem is I start tidying, get bored (or run out of time) and end up with twice as much mess as before.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::MY CAT IS A DICK. Featuring quite a lot of vomit and poo, so perhaps best not perused over luncheon. http://t.co/epD4MqPL (via Steve Duffy)
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::WILL YOU SURVIVE A NUCLEAR ATTACK??? This may be on facebook so not sure if you can access it. http://t.co/oHC9EgM4 (via Steve Duffy)
TW:::AnneBillson:::@glitternova @johnwarrender 10 mins a day is good idea. I always feel like tidying up JUST before bedtime. So put it off b/c need the sleep.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@trim_obey After watching that film was SO grateful I wasn't married with kids & high-flying career. Looked like HELL. So film had its uses.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@glitternova I did that when I was earning more money. It was GREAT.  I also paid someone to do my ironing. I NEVER do ironing. EVER.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@glitternova @johnwarrender I like tidy too. But if I start tidying up, I won't get work done. And if I don't get it done I can't pay rent.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::Sorry, that probably should have been "ÉCOUTES-MOI! ÉCOUTES-MOI!" Grammar and spelling and all that.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::"ÉCOUTE MOI! ÉCOUTE MOI!" Yes, angry woman downstairs, I am écouting. You're so loud I HAVE NO CHOICE. How long is this argument anyway?
TW:::AnneBillson:::@IanMundell @dcairns Ha! I even understood a few lines of that. "Wat is it?" But Bobbie has to be the most boring translation of Milou EVER.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::How do working women run husbands and babies and a social life as well? I have none of these things, yet STILL can't find time to tidy flat.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@icelandbob Not really. But it's the only pay I have.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@Han_So @johnwarrender Good. Something to look forward to. Community on hiatus. Lost patience with True Blood, losing it with Boardwalk Emp.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::Ah the freelancer's life. Promised info for work this w/e hasn't been delivered. No-one in offices, of course. All-nighters loom next week.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@johnwarrender 1st episode didn't grab me. But aiming to read Dutch translation of book, so may return at a later date if I get into it.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@IanMundell It's a frigging DAYTRIP up to Heysel! Audience at The Thing was so badly behaved, staff actually marched a bunch of them out!
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@IanMundell @dcairns They should have tried harder to fill up all the screens with Tintin. They really should have dubbed it into Flemish.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@catvincent Believe me, part one of that franchise was a MASTERPIECE compared to this one.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@TheVodkaYeti It's OK, I never get any presents anyway.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@catvincent Up to a point. I've just been reading synopses and it's starting to come back to me. Unfortunately. Gawd, it was baaaaaaad.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@jimthehedgehog But Omar Sharif didn't have a leading role in Top Secret! Also, Top Secret! was funny. Little Fockers is not. Not remotely.
TW:::AnneBillson:::Yay, I just blocked Santa Claus! How Scroogey is that?
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@EvrimErsoy I odn't know about Brussels. Last Christmas I was living in Paris and they do there.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::Oh my lovely (sarcasm) downstairs neighbours are having a screaming-at-the-top-of-their-lungs, door-slamming, flat-rattling argument. Great.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@dcairns @IanMundell Nooooooo! Don't give them ideas! (It was actually on EIGHT screens a couple of weeks ago, which is bad enough)
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@IanMundell You were right about Kinepolis, by the way. It's the Multiplex From Hell.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@SteveSparshott Is Daniel Day-Lewis doing a Big Momma's House film? I'd quite like to see that. (Though have avoided all BMH films so far)
TW:::AnneBillson:::@catvincent Little Fockers.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@KirklandCiccone I don't hate The Thing (prequel). I just thought it was very disappointing, sloppy, lazy and totally lacking in tension.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@IanMundell And it does bug me when 10 of the 18 UGC screens in Brussels are taken up with Tintin and Twilight.
TW:::AnneBillson:::@IanMundell It IS UGC's fault they're raising the price of their carte. Now paying as much as I was in Paris, for about 100th of the choice.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::That last tweet is the only thing I can find that I wrote about LITTLE FOCKERS, which I foolishly went to see on Christmas Day 2010.
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::Just watched arguably the greatest actor of his generation in film containing gags about anuses, projectile vomiting & erectile dysfunction.
TW:::AnneBillson:::Yet again UGC lets me down. 10 of 18 Brussels UGC screens full of Tintin & Twilight. No room for 50/50, The Thing or Kevin. @ugcdistribution
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::Yet again UGC lets me down. 10 of 18 Brussels screens full of Tintin & Twilight. So have to go to ends of the earth if I want to see 50/50.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@pavlov2313 is it worth sticking with? I might try a few more eps. I like Jessica Lange. And frequent male nudity!
TW:::AnneBillson:::@DanielNothing @Krizanovich Which is?
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@pavlov2313 You mean American Horror Story? Only seen 1st episode; amusing, though didn't really GRAB me. Might watch more at a later date.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@DanielNothing I think the bromance question was from @Krizanovich. But I'm still interested in hearing the definition.
TW:::AnneBillson:::I take notes as aide-memoires for when I write films up 12 months later. But seems LITTLE FOCKERS was so appalling I couldn't even do that.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@Tuess @cathylomax It's officially a Young Adult novel, but you might enjoy it even if she doesn't! (though I'd be surprised if she doesn't)
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::Red lipstick is "in" again. So I'll go on wearing it, shall I? Guardian article makes it sound complicated & difficult. http://t.co/7vyh3qLp
TW:::AnneBillson:::@BobCoupee @barryegan1575 I think when I wrote "amazing" it was meant to be sarcastic. But doesn't it just make you want to spit?
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@Tuess @cathylomax Oh, try buying her the Hunger Games trilogy for Christmas. I couldn't put it down. It's coming out as a film next year.
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@anfo_ I love Doe Maar! Plus I think listening to them is very good for my Dutch vocabulary. "Ik droomde de waarheid en hij kwam hard aan."
TW:::AnneBillson:::@Krizanovich I shall look into the subject, but it will have to be at a later date. Maybe worth a blog.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@Krizanovich Men/women/cats? Hmm, have general impression cats are seen as more of a feminine adjunct. No way of backing this up, though.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@Tuess @cathylomax I can imagine. But hope you encourage her to watch Buffy/read Hunger Games too. I prefer my heroines a bit less passive!
TW:::AnneBillson:::Amazing. Around the same time Newt Gingrich was trying to indict Bill Clinton over Monica Lewinsky, he was having an extra-marital affair.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@Tuess @cathylomax You, sir, are a star!
FB:::AnneBillson:::DIRECT:::@Tuess @CathyLomax 2nd viewing? I'm impressed by your dedication!
TW:::AnneBillson:::@Tuess If I were the screenwriter I don't know how I would have solved the wolf telepathy thing. But that was absolutely NOT the solution!
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@Tuess Thought it was a weakness in the book that she switched to point of view of Jacob. I wanted to know what Bella was going through!
FB:::AnneBillson:::GROUP:::@Tuess They should have made wolf noises with subtitles, surely. Almost tempted to go see the dubbed-into-French version. (But not really.)
TW:::AnneBillson:::Brussels madness is fête de Saint Verhaegen, kind of like student rag week. Only someone died (after I'd left), so now it's been cancelled.
GP:::AnneBillson:::random:::@BelgianWaffling Oh I see. Saint Verhaegen. The saint white coats. And pissing in the street, obviously. I saw men's WILLIES.
FB:::AnneBillson:::WALL:::@BelgianWaffling What was the parade for? What was going on? Is it Belgium Day or something? It was madness, I tell you, MADNESS.
